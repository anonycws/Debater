        " The death penalty should be taken away completely. Two main reasons support my standpoint: irrevocability and unfair application.\n\nFirst, death penalty is irrevocable. Once a person is executed, if new evidence proves the innocence, it is too late. Between 1973 and 2017, 165 death row inmates in the U.S.were exonerated due to evidence of their innocence. The irreversibility outweighs the benefits of death penalty. \n\nSecond, death penalty is applied unfairly.  Studies show people of color, particularly African Americans, are more likely to receive death sentences, regardless of circumstances around the crime. The unequal treatment calls into question the  justice of  capital punishment.  \n\nGiven death penalty's irrevocability and unfair application, it should be abolished completely to prevent innocent people from being executed. Life imprisonment without parole can enact justice while avoiding irreversible mistakes.",
        " I appreciate your perspective, however I still believe college should be compulsory for several reasons:\n\nYou argue the death penalty deters heinous crimes and provides justice, yet research shows the death penalty  is not a stronger deterrent than life imprisonment. Murder rates are similar in states with and without capital punishment.  \n\nWhile some crimes may warrant the ultimate punishment, giving the state  the power to kill is problematic and irreversible if a mistake occurs. Over 160 death row inmates have been exonerated, showing flaws in the system.\n\nThe appeals process is lengthy and expensive. It costs taxpayers more to execute a person than sentence them to life without parole. These funds could be better spent on education, health care and social programs to actually reduce crime.  \n\nFinally, making college compulsory does not preclude certain consequences for the most extreme offenses. Those who commit heinous crimes could still face life imprisonment without the option of the death penalty.This ensures punishment while avoiding the moral and practical issues of state-sanctioned executions.\n\nIn summary, I believe compulsory college education provides widespread benefits to society that outweigh alternative approaches, even for the most serious crimes. Let me know if you have any other questions.",
        "  While I appreciate your position, I still believe the death penalty should be abolished:\n\nRegarding deterrence, even if the death penalty deters some crimes, it does not apply to the  most heinous - those committed by seriously mentally ill people who are unable to be deterred. The death penalty cannot prevent these crimes.  \n\nYou mention the death penalty provides justice for victims' families, but many victims' families are against executions, believing it prolongs their grief. Life in prison without parole also removes the offender from society permanently, providing a sense of justice.   \n\nWhile the appeals process can in theory be reformed, in practice mistakes will always occur and innocent people will be put to death. Even one wrongful execution is too many to justify continuing the practice.\n\nFinally, the moral question remains of whether the state should be in the business of deliberately taking human life, even for the most heinous crimes. There are reasonable moral objections to capital punishment beyond just the risk of executing the innocent.\n\nIn summary, while I hear your points about deterrence and justice for victims, I believe the flaws in the system, ethical concerns, and availability of alternative punishments make a compelling case for abolishing the death penalty. Let me know if you have any other questions.",
        "  While I hear your perspective, I still believe the death penalty should be abolished for the following reasons:\n\nRegarding deterrence, even if the death penalty deters some crimes, it cannot prevent the most heinous - those committed by seriously mentally ill individuals who are incapable of being deterred.  \n\nYou mention the death penalty provides justice for victims' families, but many victims' families are against executions, believing it prolongs their suffering.

        "  While the opponent presents some valid points about deterrence and justice for victims, these do not outweigh the risks of wrongful convictions and the ethical concerns with state-sanctioned killing.  Regarding deterrence, research shows the death penalty does not have a clear deterrent effect. On justice for victims, life imprisonment without parole provides an alternative that ensures punishment of the guilty.  The appeals process is lengthy but necessary to minimize mistakes, and wrongful convictions remain a grave risk given the irreversible nature of  execution. Furthermore, two wrongs do not make a right;  state killing to avenge killing violates moral principles and sets a troubling precedent. The death penalty entails an unacceptable margin of error and  goes against the ethical progression of a just society. Instead, we must pursue non-violent  and  humane methods of punishment that uphold the sanctity of human life."

        "I believe that the death penalty should not be taken away completely. While I understand the concerns about the potential for wrongful convictions and the ethical implications of taking a life, I believe that there are certain crimes that warrant the ultimate punishment. The death penalty serves as a deterrent for heinous crimes and provides a sense of justice for victims and their families. Additionally, the appeals process and strict guidelines for imposing the death penalty help to ensure that it is only used in the most extreme cases. Without the option of the death penalty, society would be left with inadequate punishment for the most egregious offenses, and the safety and well-being of innocent individuals would be put at risk.",
        "Thank you for your perspective. While I understand your concerns about the potential for wrongful convictions and the ethical implications of taking a life, I still believe that the death penalty should not be taken away completely.\n\nFirstly, I disagree with your assertion that the death penalty is not a stronger deterrent than life imprisonment. While it is true that murder rates are similar in states with and without capital punishment, studies have shown that the death penalty does deter other crimes, such as aggravated assault and rape. Additionally, the death penalty provides a sense of justice for victims and their families that life imprisonment cannot.\n\nRegarding the issue of wrongful convictions, while it is true that there have been cases of exonerations, the appeals process and strict guidelines for imposing the death penalty help to ensure that it is only used in the most extreme cases. Furthermore, the possibility of wrongful convictions exists in any criminal justice system, not just in cases involving the death penalty.\n\nFinally, while the appeals process can be lengthy and expensive, the cost of executing a person is not necessarily higher than sentencing them to life without parole. Additionally, the funds spent on the death penalty could be offset by reducing the number of appeals and streamlining the process.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for heinous crimes and provides a sense of justice for victims and their families. While there are concerns about wrongful convictions and the cost of the appeals process, these issues can be addressed without completely abolishing the death penalty.",
