        "As the positive side, we firmly believe that it is advisable to judge heroes by their success or failure. Success and failure are tangible outcomes that reflect the effectiveness of a hero's actions and decisions. By evaluating heroes based on these outcomes, we can better understand their impact on society and the world at large. Furthermore, this approach encourages heroes to strive for excellence and learn from their mistakes, ultimately leading to a more just and prosperous society. While we acknowledge that heroes may possess admirable qualities regardless of their success, it is crucial to recognize that the ultimate goal of heroism is to create positive change. Therefore, judging heroes by their success or failure is a practical and necessary method for assessing their true worth and contributions to society.",
        "While we understand the concerns of the negative side, we argue that success and failure are still crucial factors in evaluating heroes. Although luck, timing, and external circumstances can influence outcomes, heroes are often defined by their ability to overcome adversity and achieve their goals despite these challenges. By considering success and failure, we can assess a hero's adaptability, resilience, and determination, which are essential qualities for heroism.\n\nFurthermore, we do not advocate for solely judging heroes based on success or failure, but rather emphasizing their importance in the evaluation process. Character, values, and actions are indeed significant, but without tangible results, these qualities may not lead to meaningful change. By incorporating success and failure into our assessment, we can ensure a comprehensive understanding of a hero's impact on society and avoid the pitfalls of a narrow and biased perspective.",

        "My standpoint is that it is not advisable to judge heroes solely based on their success or failure. Success and failure are subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as luck, timing, and external circumstances. Heroes should be judged based on their character, values, and actions. A hero's success or failure does not necessarily reflect their true worth or contribution to society. Moreover, judging heroes solely based on their success or failure can lead to a narrow and biased perspective, which may overlook the complexity and nuances of their achievements. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple factors when evaluating heroes and not rely solely on their success or failure.",
