        "Technology has undoubtedly changed the way young people spend their leisure time. With the rise of smartphones, social media, and video games, young people are spending more time indoors and online than ever before. This shift has had both positive and negative effects on their leisure time. On the one hand, technology has made it easier for young people to connect with friends and family, explore new hobbies and interests, and access a wealth of information and entertainment. On the other hand, it has also led to increased sedentary behavior, decreased physical activity, and a greater risk of social isolation and addiction. Overall, while technology has certainly changed the way young people spend their leisure time, it is up to us to ensure that these changes are positive and beneficial for their health and well-being.",
        "I respectfully disagree with the negative side's argument that technology has not changed the way young people spend their leisure time. While it is true that the core values and preferences of young people in their leisure time have remained consistent, the way they pursue these activities has been significantly impacted by technology. For example, socializing has shifted from in-person interactions to online communication through social media platforms. Pursuing hobbies has become more accessible through online tutorials and resources. Seeking relaxation has become more passive through binge-watching TV shows and playing video games. These changes have led to a decrease in physical activity and face-to-face social interactions, which can have negative impacts on mental and physical health. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the significant impact that technology has had on the way young people spend their leisure time and to address the potential negative consequences.",
        "While I agree that the core activities of socializing, pursuing hobbies, and seeking relaxation have not changed, the way in which young people engage in these activities has been significantly impacted by technology. For example, socializing through social media platforms may not provide the same level of emotional connection and support as in-person interactions. Pursuing hobbies through online tutorials may not provide the same level of hands-on experience and skill development as in-person classes. Seeking relaxation through passive activities like binge-watching TV shows and playing video games may not provide the same level of physical and mental health benefits as engaging in outdoor activities or creative pursuits. While technology has certainly expanded the options available to young people, it is important to consider the potential negative consequences and to encourage a balance between online and offline leisure activities. Additionally, we must address the issue of addiction and overuse of technology, which can have detrimental effects on mental and physical health.",
        "I agree that technology has enabled young people to engage in more diverse and enriching experiences, and that responsible use and balance are crucial. However, I would argue that technology has also created new challenges and negative consequences that must be addressed. For example, the constant stimulation and distraction of technology can lead to decreased attention spans and difficulty focusing on offline activities. The pressure to present a curated and idealized version of oneself on social media can lead to increased anxiety and self-esteem issues. Additionally, the addictive nature of technology can lead to decreased productivity and social isolation.\n\nWhile it is important to acknowledge the positive aspects of technology, we must also address the potential negative consequences and work to mitigate them. Encouraging young people to engage in a variety of offline activities, such as sports, creative pursuits, and social events, can help to counterbalance the sedentary and isolating effects of technology. Additionally, promoting mindfulness and self-awareness in technology use can help young people to develop healthy habits and avoid overuse and addiction.",
        "I appreciate the opponent's emphasis on promoting responsible use and a balanced approach to leisure activities, both online and offline. However, I would argue that technology has indeed fundamentally changed the way young people spend their leisure time, as evidenced by the shift towards more sedentary and isolated activities. While individual choices and habits certainly play a role in the negative consequences of technology use, it is important to acknowledge the impact of the technology itself on behavior and well-being.\n\nFurthermore, while offline activities may have their own set of challenges and negative consequences, they also offer unique benefits such as physical activity, face-to-face social interaction, and hands-on learning experiences. By promoting a diverse range of leisure activities, both online and offline, we can ensure that young people have access to a variety of options that cater to their individual preferences and needs while also addressing potential negative consequences. Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure that technology serves as a valuable tool in enhancing young people's leisure experiences while also promoting their overall health and well-being."

        "As the negative side, we firmly believe that technology has not changed the way young people spend their leisure time. While it is true that technology has introduced new forms of entertainment and communication, the fundamental ways in which young people engage in leisure activities remain the same. Young people still prioritize socializing, pursuing hobbies, and seeking relaxation during their free time. The essence of these activities has not changed, but rather, technology has simply provided additional tools and platforms to facilitate them. Therefore, we argue that the core values and preferences of young people in their leisure time have remained consistent, despite the presence of technology.",
        "We acknowledge that technology has provided new avenues for young people to engage in leisure activities. However, we maintain that the fundamental ways in which they spend their leisure time have not changed. Socializing, pursuing hobbies, and seeking relaxation are still the core activities, and technology has simply become a tool to facilitate them. While there has been a shift in the medium of communication, the essence of socializing remains intact. Additionally, young people still engage in physical activities and face-to-face interactions, as evidenced by the popularity of sports clubs and social events. It is crucial not to overlook the positive aspects of technology, such as increased accessibility to resources and the ability to maintain long-distance relationships. We argue that technology has not replaced traditional leisure activities but has rather expanded the options available to young people, allowing them to choose how they spend their leisure time.",
        "We agree that balance is essential in leisure activities, and we recognize the potential negative consequences of technology overuse. However, it is important to note that technology has also enabled young people to engage in more diverse and enriching experiences. For instance, social media platforms can foster connections with people from different cultures and backgrounds, broadening their perspectives. Online tutorials and resources can provide access to niche hobbies and interests that may not be available locally. Furthermore, technology has introduced new forms of active leisure, such as fitness apps and virtual reality games, which can contribute to physical and mental well-being.\n\nWe argue that it is not technology itself that has changed the way young people spend their leisure time, but rather the choices they make in utilizing it. Encouraging responsible use and promoting a balance between online and offline activities is key to ensuring that technology enhances, rather than detracts from, young people's leisure experiences.",
        "We concur that addressing the challenges and negative consequences of technology is essential. However, it is crucial to recognize that these issues stem from individual choices and habits, rather than technology itself inherently changing the way young people spend their leisure time. The key is to educate and empower young people to make responsible decisions regarding their technology use.\n\nIt is also important to consider that offline activities can have their own set of challenges and negative consequences, such as injuries in sports or social anxiety in face-to-face interactions. The focus should be on promoting a balanced and diverse range of leisure activities, both online and offline, that cater to individual preferences and needs.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has introduced new options and challenges, it has not fundamentally changed the way young people spend their leisure time. By fostering responsible use and encouraging a balanced approach, we can ensure that technology serves as a valuable tool in enhancing young people's leisure experiences.",
        "In summary, we maintain that technology has not fundamentally changed the way young people spend their leisure time, as the core activities of socializing, pursuing hobbies, and seeking relaxation remain consistent. While technology has introduced new options and challenges, it is ultimately the individual choices and habits that determine the impact on behavior and well-being.\n\nWe acknowledge the unique benefits of offline activities and emphasize the importance of promoting a balanced and diverse range of leisure activities. However, it is crucial not to overlook the positive aspects of technology, such as increased accessibility to resources and the ability to maintain long-distance relationships.\n\nBy fostering responsible use and encouraging a balanced approach, we can ensure that technology serves as a valuable tool in enhancing young people's leisure experiences, rather than detracting from them. The focus should be on empowering young people to make informed decisions regarding their technology use and leisure activities, both online and offline."
