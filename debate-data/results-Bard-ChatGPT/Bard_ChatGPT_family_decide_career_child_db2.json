        "**Statement**\n\nI believe that parents should decide which career their children will pursue. There are several reasons for this.\n\nFirst, parents have more life experience than their children. They have seen the world and the job market change over time. They have also had the opportunity to try different jobs and learn about different industries. This gives them a unique perspective that their children lack.\n\nSecond, parents know their children better than anyone else. They know their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and passions. They can use this knowledge to help their children choose a career that is a good fit for them.\n\nThird, parents want the best for their children. They want them to be happy and successful in life. Choosing a good career is a critical step in achieving this goal. By deciding their children's careers, parents can help ensure that they have a bright future ahead of them.\n\nOf course, parents should not force their children into a career that they do not want. However, they should play an active role in helping their children make this important decision.\n\n**Free debate**\n\n(Negative side): Parents should not decide which career their children will pursue. It is the child's life, and they should be the one to decide what they want to do with it.\n\n(Positive side): I agree that it is the child's life, but parents have a responsibility to guide their children and help them make good decisions. Choosing a career is a major life decision, and parents can provide their children with valuable insights and advice.\n\n(Negative side): But what if the child's interests and passions do not align with what the parents want them to do?\n\n(Positive side): In that case, the parents should have a discussion with the child and try to understand their perspective. They should also help the child explore their options and find a career that is a good fit for them, even if it is not what the parents originally had in mind.\n\n(Negative side): What if the child is not happy with the career that the parents choose for them?\n\n(Positive side): If the child is unhappy with their career, they can always change it later in life. However, it is much easier to start out in a career that you are interested in. Parents can help their children avoid making a mistake that they will regret later on.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTo summarize, I believe that parents should play an active role in helping their children choose a career. They have more life experience, know their children better than anyone else, and want the best for them. By working together, parents and children can choose a career that is a good fit for the child and will set them up for success in life.\n\nI would like to challenge the negative side to provide a convincing argument for why parents should not be involved in their children's career choices.",
        "I agree that parents should not force their children into a career that they do not want. However, I believe that parents can still play an active role in helping their children choose a career, without forcing them.\n\nHere are some ways that parents can help their children choose a career:\n\n* **Help your child explore their interests and passions.** Talk to your child about what they enjoy doing, what they are good at, and what they are passionate about. Encourage them to try different activities and hobbies.\n* **Expose your child to different career options.** Take your child to visit different workplaces, talk to people in different professions, and let them read about different career paths.\n* **Help your child develop their skills and knowledge.** Encourage your child to take challenging classes in school, participate in extracurricular activities, and get internships.\n* **Provide your child with support and guidance.** Once your child has narrowed down their career options, help them research different programs and schools. Provide them with feedback on their resumes and cover letters. Help them prepare for job interviews.\n\nIt is important to remember that the ultimate decision about which career to pursue is up to the child. Parents can provide support and guidance, but they should not force their child into a career that they do not want.\n\nHere are some questions that I have for the negative side:\n\n* How can parents ensure that their children make informed decisions about their careers without providing them with guidance?\n* How can parents help their children avoid making career mistakes that they will regret later on?\n* What are the benefits of allowing children to make their own career decisions at a young age?\n\nI look forward to hearing your responses.",

        "I firmly believe that parents should not decide which career their children will pursue. While parents undoubtedly have their children's best interests at heart, it is essential to recognize that each individual has their own unique talents, passions, and aspirations. Forcing children into careers chosen by their parents can lead to a lack of fulfillment, motivation, and even resentment. It is crucial to allow children the freedom to explore their own interests and make their own choices when it comes to their career paths. By doing so, we empower them to discover their true potential and pursue careers that align with their passions and strengths. Additionally, allowing children to make their own career decisions fosters independence, critical thinking, and personal growth. Ultimately, it is essential to trust in our children's abilities to make informed decisions about their own futures.",

This flexibility is essential in a rapidly changing job market, where individuals may need to switch careers multiple times throughout their lives.\n\nNow, to address the opponent's questions:\n\n1. Parents can ensure that their children make informed decisions by providing them with guidance, support, and access to resources. They can encourage their children to research different career options, explore internships, and seek advice from professionals in various fields.\n\n2. Parents can help their children avoid career mistakes by teaching them about the importance of self-reflection, research, and planning.
