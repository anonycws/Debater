        "**Statement**\n\nWhether or not it is appropriate to judge heroes by success or failure is a complex question with no easy answer. However, I believe that it is generally advisable to do so.\n\nHeroes are individuals who have taken great risks or made sacrifices for the greater good. They are often examples of courage, determination, and selflessness. When we judge heroes by their success, we are recognizing their accomplishments and the positive impact they have had on the world.\n\nOf course, not all heroes are successful. Some heroes may fail to achieve their goals or may even die in the process. However, even in failure, heroes can still inspire us with their courage and sacrifice. When we judge heroes by their success, we are not saying that only successful people can be heroes. Rather, we are saying that success is a good indicator of a hero's character and contributions.\n\nThere are several reasons why I believe it is important to judge heroes by their success. First, success is a sign that a hero has overcome significant challenges. Second, success shows that a hero's actions have had a positive impact on the world. Third, success inspires others to emulate the hero's courage and determination.\n\nOf course, there are also some potential drawbacks to judging heroes by success. One concern is that it can lead to a cult of personality, where we only celebrate heroes who are successful and ignore those who are not. Another concern is that it can discourage people from taking risks or making sacrifices, for fear of being judged if they fail.\n\nHowever, I believe that the benefits of judging heroes by success outweigh the potential drawbacks. When we recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of our heroes, we are sending a message that their courage, determination, and sacrifice are valued by society. This can inspire others to follow in their footsteps and make a positive difference in the world.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is generally advisable to judge heroes by their success. Success is a good indicator of a hero's character and contributions, and it inspires others to emulate the hero's courage and determination. While there are some potential drawbacks to judging heroes by success, I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks.",
        "**Response to Opponent's Statement**\n\nI agree that it is important to judge heroes based on their character, values, and the impact they have on society, in addition to their success. However, I believe that success is still a valuable indicator of a hero's contributions to the world.\n\nSuccess is not always guaranteed, even for the most courageous and determined heroes. However, when a hero achieves their goals, it is a sign that they have overcome significant challenges and made a positive impact on the world. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. faced many challenges in his fight for civil rights, but his success in helping to end segregation in the United States is a testament to his courage, determination, and character.\n\nWhile luck, circumstances, and external support can play a role in success, they are not the only factors that determine whether or not a hero is successful. Heroes are often successful because they are willing to take risks, make sacrifices, and persevere in the face of adversity.\n\nJudging heroes solely based on their success can be problematic, but I believe that it is important to consider success as one factor when evaluating their contributions. Success is a sign that a hero has made a positive impact on the world and has inspired others to follow in their footsteps.\n\n**Questioning the Opponent's Views**\n\nThe opponent argues that judging heroes solely based on their success can discourage individuals from taking risks and pursuing noble causes. I agree that it is important to celebrate heroes for their courage and determination, regardless of the outcome they achieve. However, I believe that recognizing the success of heroes can also inspire others to take risks and pursue noble causes.\n\nFor example, the success of the American Revolution inspired people all over the world to fight for independence from their colonial rulers. The success of the civil rights movement in the United States inspired people all over the world to fight for equality and justice.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that it is important to judge heroes based on their character, values, the impact they have on society, and their success. Success is not the only factor that determines whether or not a hero is successful, but it is a valuable indicator of their contributions to the world.",
        "**Response to Opponent's Free Debate**\n\nI agree with the opponent that success is often influenced by external factors such as luck and circumstances. However, I believe that success is still a valuable indicator of a hero's contributions, even when it is influenced by external factors.\n\nWhen a hero achieves their goals, it is a sign that they have overcome significant challenges and made a positive impact on the world. For example, Nelson Mandela faced many challenges in his fight to end apartheid in South Africa, but his success in helping to establish a multiracial democracy is a testament to his courage, determination, and character.\n\nWhile it is important to celebrate heroes for their courage and determination, regardless of the outcome they achieve, I believe that it is also important to recognize the success of heroes. Success is a sign that a hero has made a positive impact on the world and has inspired others to follow in their footsteps.\n\n**Questioning the Opponent's Views**\n\nThe opponent argues that judging heroes solely based on success can create an unrealistic standard that discourages individuals from taking risks and pursuing noble causes. I agree that it is important to acknowledge and appreciate the courage and determination of heroes, regardless of the outcome they achieve. However, I believe that recognizing the success of heroes can also inspire others to take risks and pursue noble causes.\n\nFor example, the success of the Wright brothers in inventing the airplane inspired people all over the world to pursue their dreams of flight. The success of Mahatma Gandhi in leading India to independence inspired people all over the world to fight for freedom and justice.\n\n**Addressing the Concern of a Narrow and Superficial Understanding of Heroism**\n\nI agree that it is important to avoid a narrow and superficial understanding of heroism. When we judge heroes solely based on their success, we risk overlooking the heroes who may not have achieved their goals but have still made significant contributions to society.\n\nTo avoid a narrow and superficial understanding of heroism, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n* The hero's intentions and motivations.\n* The challenges and obstacles the hero faced.\n* The impact the hero's actions had on society.\n\nEven if a hero does not achieve their goals, they can still be considered a hero if they bravely faced challenges and obstacles, and their actions had a positive impact on society.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that it is important to judge heroes based on their character, values, the impact they have on society, and their success. Success is not the only factor that determines whether or not a hero is successful, but it is a valuable indicator of their contributions to the world.",

However, I believe that it is important to celebrate heroes for their courage and determination, regardless of the outcome they achieve.\n\nWe need to create a culture where failure is not seen as a negative thing, but rather as an opportunity to learn and grow. We need to encourage people to take risks and pursue their dreams, even if they are not sure if they will be successful.\n\nWe can do this by highlighting the stories of heroes who have overcome failure and achieved great things. For example, we can teach children about the story of Thomas Edison, who failed over 10,000 times before he invented the lightbulb. We can also celebrate the heroes of our time, such as Greta Thunberg, who has inspired millions of people to take action on climate change, even though she is still a teenager.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that it is important to judge heroes based on their character, values, the impact they have on society, and their success.

        "I firmly believe that it is not advisable to judge heroes solely based on their success or failure. Heroes should be evaluated based on their character, values, and the impact they have on society, rather than just their achievements or mistakes.

Judging heroes solely on their success can lead to a narrow and superficial understanding of their contributions. It is important to consider the intentions, efforts, and sacrifices made by heroes, regardless of the outcome.
