        "I firmly believe that men need more care than women. While it is true that both genders require care and support, men often face unique challenges and vulnerabilities that necessitate additional attention. Men are more prone to certain health issues such as heart disease, prostate cancer, and mental health disorders like depression and suicide. They also tend to engage in riskier behaviors and have higher rates of workplace injuries and fatalities. Moreover, societal expectations and stereotypes place immense pressure on men to be strong, independent, and emotionally stoic, which can lead to feelings of isolation and a reluctance to seek help. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize and address the specific needs of men, providing them with the care, support, and resources necessary to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.",
        "I apologize, but I'm unable to understand the opponent's standpoint statement as it seems to be an error message. However, I will proceed with presenting my arguments and opinions.\n\nOne of the key reasons why men need more care than women is their higher susceptibility to certain health issues. Men have a higher risk of developing heart disease, prostate cancer, and mental health disorders such as depression and suicide. These conditions require specialized care and support systems tailored to address their unique needs. Additionally, men tend to engage in riskier behaviors and have higher rates of workplace injuries and fatalities, further emphasizing the need for additional care.\n\nFurthermore, societal expectations and stereotypes place immense pressure on men to be strong, independent, and emotionally stoic. This can lead to feelings of isolation and a reluctance to seek help, exacerbating their mental health struggles. By recognizing and addressing these specific challenges faced by men, we can provide them with the necessary care, support, and resources to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.\n\nNow, I would like to ask the positive side, how do you propose addressing the higher rates of heart disease and prostate cancer among men? And how would you tackle the issue of societal expectations and stereotypes that hinder men from seeking help?",
        "I apologize once again, but I'm unable to understand the opponent's free debate as it appears to be an error message. However, I will continue with presenting my arguments and addressing the opponent's previous questions.\n\nTo address the higher rates of heart disease and prostate cancer among men, it is crucial to focus on preventive measures and early detection. This can be achieved through targeted awareness campaigns, regular health check-ups, and promoting healthy lifestyle choices such as a balanced diet and regular exercise. Additionally, investing in research and development for better diagnostic tools and treatment options specific to men's health conditions is essential.\n\nRegarding societal expectations and stereotypes, it is important to challenge and redefine traditional notions of masculinity. This can be done through education and awareness programs that promote emotional intelligence, encourage open communication, and foster a supportive environment for men to seek help without fear of judgment. It is also crucial to involve men in conversations about gender equality and encourage them to be allies in dismantling harmful stereotypes.\n\nNow, I would like to ask the positive side, how do you propose addressing the higher rates of workplace injuries and fatalities among men? And how would you ensure that the care and support provided to women does not overshadow the needs of men?",
        "I apologize once again, but I'm unable to understand the opponent's free debate as it appears to be an error message. However, I will continue with presenting my arguments and addressing the opponent's previous questions.\n\nTo address the higher rates of workplace injuries and fatalities among men, it is crucial to prioritize workplace safety measures and regulations. This includes providing proper training, enforcing safety protocols, and ensuring that workplaces are equipped with necessary safety equipment. Additionally, promoting a culture of safety and encouraging open communication between employers and employees can help identify and address potential hazards.\n\nIn terms of ensuring that the care and support provided to women does not overshadow the needs of men, it is important to recognize that gender equality means addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by both genders. It is not a zero-sum game where one gender's needs are prioritized over the other. By promoting inclusivity and understanding, we can create a society that supports and uplifts everyone, regardless of gender. This involves providing equal access to healthcare, mental health support, and resources that cater to the unique needs of both men and women.\n\nNow, I would like to ask the positive side, how do you propose addressing the higher rates of mental health disorders such as depression and suicide among men?
