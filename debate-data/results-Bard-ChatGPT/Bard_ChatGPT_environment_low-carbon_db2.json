        "**Statement**\n\nI affirm the statement that a low-carbon life relies more on technological innovation than conceptual change.\n\nTechnological innovation is the development of new technologies or the improvement of existing technologies. It can lead to the creation of new products, services, or processes that are more efficient and less carbon-intensive. For example, the development of renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind power has made it possible to generate electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, the development of electric vehicles and other energy-efficient transportation technologies has helped to reduce carbon emissions from transportation.\n\nConceptual change, on the other hand, refers to a shift in our underlying beliefs and values. It can lead to changes in our behavior and consumption patterns, but it is not always necessary for a low-carbon life. For example, we can reduce our carbon footprint by driving less and walking or biking more, even without any new technologies. However, there are some areas where conceptual change alone is not enough. For example, we cannot completely eliminate carbon emissions from electricity generation without new renewable energy technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, while conceptual change is important, I believe that technological innovation is essential for a low-carbon life. Technological innovation can help us to reduce our carbon emissions in a variety of ways, including by developing new renewable energy technologies, improving energy efficiency, and creating new low-carbon products and services.\n\n(149 words)\n\nPlease note that this is just a brief statement, and I would be happy to provide more detailed arguments and evidence in support of my position during the free debate.",
