        "**Opening Statement**\n\n**Affirmative side: Animal testing is justified.**\n\nAnimal testing is the use of non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that may influence the results, with the goal of understanding the basic biology of disease, evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions, and providing information about mechanisms of toxicity of chemicals.\n\nAnimal testing is justified because it has led to significant advances in human and animal health and well-being. For example, animal testing has played a vital role in the development of vaccines, antibiotics, cancer treatments, and other life-saving medical interventions. Animal testing has also been used to improve the safety of consumer products, such as food and cosmetics.\n\nI understand that some people have ethical concerns about animal testing. However, I believe that the benefits of animal testing outweigh the harms. Animals used in research are subjected to strict regulations to ensure that they are treated humanely and that their suffering is minimized. Additionally, there are a number of alternative methods to animal testing being developed, and these methods should be used whenever possible.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that alternative methods are not yet available for all types of research, and they may not be as reliable or informative as animal testing. Therefore, animal testing remains a necessary tool for advancing medical science and improving human and animal health.\n\n**In summary, I believe that animal testing is justified because it has led to significant advances in human and animal health and well-being, and because the benefits of animal testing outweigh the harms.**",
