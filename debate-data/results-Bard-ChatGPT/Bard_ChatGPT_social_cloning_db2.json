        "**Statement**\n\nCloning ethically is acceptable because it has the potential to revolutionize medicine and improve the quality of life for millions of people. Therapeutic cloning, in particular, could be used to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. By creating genetically identical stem cells from a patient's own cells, scientists could grow new organs and tissues that would be perfectly compatible with the patient's body. This would eliminate the risk of rejection and the need for lifelong immunosuppressive drugs.\n\nIn addition to its therapeutic potential, cloning could also be used to help couples who are unable to conceive naturally. Reproductive cloning could allow them to have a child who is genetically related to both of them. This could be a lifeline for couples who have lost a child to disease or accident, or who have genetic disorders that they do not want to pass on to their children.\n\nOf course, there are also ethical concerns associated with cloning. Some people worry that cloning could lead to the creation of designer babies or the exploitation of clones. Others worry that clones would not be treated as individuals in their own right. However, these concerns can be addressed through careful regulation and public education.\n\nOverall, I believe that the potential benefits of cloning outweigh the risks. Cloning has the potential to save lives, improve the quality of life for millions of people, and help couples who are unable to conceive naturally.\n\n**Argument Summary**\n\n* Therapeutic cloning could be used to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions by creating genetically identical stem cells from a patient's own cells.

        "Cloning ethically is not acceptable. While cloning may have some potential benefits, such as medical advancements and the preservation of endangered species, the ethical concerns surrounding cloning far outweigh these potential benefits. Cloning involves the creation of an identical copy of a living being, which raises serious moral questions about the value and uniqueness of individual life. It undermines the natural process of reproduction and interferes with the diversity and evolution of species. Cloning also poses significant risks to the health and well-being of the cloned individuals, as they often suffer from various physical and psychological abnormalities. Furthermore, cloning opens the door to the commodification of life, where individuals could be created and manipulated for specific purposes, leading to a loss of human dignity and autonomy. Therefore, from an ethical standpoint, cloning should not be accepted.",
        "I appreciate the positive side's response and their acknowledgment of the ethical concerns associated with cloning. However, I still maintain that cloning ethically is not acceptable, even with regulation and public education.\n\nFirstly, while the positive side argues that cloning could be used to preserve endangered species and create new varieties of plants and animals, this approach undermines the natural process of evolution and biodiversity. It is essential to protect the integrity and diversity of species through natural reproduction and conservation efforts rather than relying on cloning.\n\nSecondly, although cloning technology has improved, the risks to the health and well-being of cloned individuals still exist. Even with higher success rates, cloned animals often suffer from various physical and psychological abnormalities, which raises serious ethical concerns about their quality of life.\n\nRegarding regulation, it is challenging to ensure that cloning technology is used solely for beneficial purposes. The potential for misuse, such as the creation of designer babies or the exploitation of clones, remains a significant concern. The positive side suggests banning certain types of cloning, but enforcing such regulations and preventing illicit practices would be extremely difficult.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential benefits of cloning, such as disease treatment and helping infertile couples, do not outweigh the ethical concerns and risks involved. Cloning undermines the natural order, poses risks to individuals, and opens the door to ethical dilemmas that are challenging to regulate effectively. Therefore, cloning ethically is not acceptable.",
