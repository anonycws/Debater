        "I firmly believe that EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is more important than IQ (Intelligence Quotient). While IQ measures cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, EQ encompasses a range of emotional and social skills that are crucial for success in personal and professional life. \n\nEQ enables individuals to understand and manage their own emotions, empathize with others, build strong relationships, and navigate social situations effectively. These skills are essential for effective communication, teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution. In contrast, high IQ alone does not guarantee success in these areas. \n\nMoreover, EQ plays a significant role in mental health and well-being. People with high EQ are better equipped to handle stress, cope with setbacks, and maintain positive relationships. In today's complex and interconnected world, where collaboration and adaptability are highly valued, EQ is increasingly recognized as a critical factor for success. Therefore, I argue that EQ is more important than IQ.",

While IQ may be an indicator of cognitive abilities, it does not encompass the essential skills needed for emotional well-being, interpersonal relationships, and success in various aspects of life. EQ, on the other hand, encompasses self-awareness, empathy, adaptability, and effective communication, which are crucial for personal and professional growth. \n\nI would like to ask the positive side: Do you believe that high IQ alone guarantees success in areas such as leadership, teamwork, and conflict resolution? And how do you address the importance of emotional intelligence in maintaining mental health and well-being?",
