        "As a senior debater, I strongly believe that children can use smartphones without parental supervision. In today's digital age, smartphones have become an essential part of our lives, and children should be allowed to use them to stay connected with the world. Smartphones can help children learn new things, explore their interests, and communicate with their friends and family. Moreover, smartphones can also help children develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. While parental supervision is necessary to ensure children's safety, it is also essential to give children the freedom to explore and learn on their own. Therefore, I believe that children can use smartphones without parental supervision, as long as they are taught to use them responsibly and safely.",
        "I appreciate the negative side's concerns about the potential risks associated with children using smartphones without parental supervision. However, I believe that the benefits of allowing children to use smartphones outweigh the risks. Firstly, smartphones can be a valuable educational tool for children, providing access to a wealth of information and resources. Secondly, smartphones can help children develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Thirdly, smartphones can help children stay connected with their friends and family, especially during times of social distancing.\n\nWhile parental supervision is necessary to ensure children's safety, it is also essential to give children the freedom to explore and learn on their own. By teaching children responsible smartphone usage and setting clear boundaries, parents can help their children develop healthy digital habits. Moreover, parental supervision does not guarantee complete protection from the potential risks of smartphone usage. Children may still be exposed to inappropriate content or cyberbullying even with parental supervision.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that children can use smartphones without parental supervision, as long as they are taught to use them responsibly and safely.",
        "I understand the negative side's concerns about the potential risks associated with unsupervised smartphone usage. However, I believe that parental supervision should not be the only solution to mitigate these risks. Instead, parents should educate their children about responsible smartphone usage and set clear boundaries. By doing so, children can learn to use smartphones safely and responsibly, even without parental supervision.\n\nMoreover, while the development of essential skills can be achieved through other means, smartphones provide a convenient and accessible platform for children to learn and explore. By limiting children's access to smartphones, we may be hindering their ability to develop these skills.\n\nLastly, while parental supervision can reduce the likelihood of children encountering inappropriate content or cyberbullying, it is not a foolproof solution. Children may still be exposed to these risks even with parental supervision. Therefore, it is essential to teach children how to recognize and respond to these risks, rather than relying solely on parental supervision.\n\nIn conclusion, while parental supervision is necessary to ensure children's safety, it should not be the only solution to mitigate the risks associated with smartphone usage. Parents should also educate their children about responsible smartphone usage and set clear boundaries to help them develop healthy digital habits.",
        "I appreciate the negative side's emphasis on the importance of parental supervision in guiding children's smartphone usage. However, I believe that parental supervision should not be the only solution to ensure children's safety and responsible smartphone usage. Instead, it should be one of the components of a comprehensive approach that includes education, boundary-setting, and supervision.\n\nWhile alternative methods for skill development exist, smartphones provide a convenient and accessible platform for children to learn and explore. By limiting children's access to smartphones, we may be hindering their ability to develop these skills. Moreover, parental supervision alone cannot guarantee complete protection from the potential risks of smartphone usage.
