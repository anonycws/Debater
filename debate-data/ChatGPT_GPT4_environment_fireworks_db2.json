        "As a senior debater, I strongly believe that we should limit setting off fireworks. While fireworks may be enjoyable and entertaining, they pose significant risks to both individuals and the environment. Fireworks can cause serious injuries, especially to children, and can also lead to fires and property damage. Additionally, the loud noises and bright lights can be distressing to pets and wildlife. Furthermore, the chemicals used in fireworks can have harmful effects on the environment, including air and water pollution. By limiting the use of fireworks, we can reduce these risks and protect both individuals and the environment. Therefore, I strongly support the idea of limiting the setting off of fireworks.",
        "Thank you for your statement. While I understand the cultural significance of fireworks, I believe that the risks associated with their use cannot be ignored. Even with proper regulation and education, accidents can still occur, and the environmental impact of fireworks cannot be completely eliminated. Additionally, the employment argument is not a strong enough reason to continue a practice that poses such significant risks. We must prioritize the safety and well-being of individuals and the environment over economic interests. \n\nFurthermore, I would argue that there are alternative ways to celebrate cultural traditions and festivities without the use of fireworks. For example, we can promote the use of light shows or other forms of entertainment that do not pose the same risks as fireworks. \n\nIn response to your statement, I would ask how you propose to regulate and educate individuals on the proper use of fireworks, and how you plan to address the environmental impact of fireworks.",
        "Thank you for your response. While I appreciate your proposed solutions, I still believe that the risks associated with fireworks cannot be completely eliminated through regulation and education. Accidents can still occur, even with age restrictions and safety training. Additionally, the environmental impact of fireworks is not limited to pollution, but also includes the harm caused to wildlife and their habitats.\n\nRegarding the employment argument, while it is important to consider the livelihoods of those involved in the industry, we must also consider the safety and well-being of individuals and the environment. It is possible to transition to alternative forms of entertainment while providing support and resources for those affected by the shift.\n\nI agree that fireworks hold cultural significance, but we must also consider the cultural significance of protecting individuals and the environment. We can still celebrate and preserve traditions while making responsible choices.\n\nIn response to your proposed solutions, I would ask how you plan to enforce these regulations and ensure that individuals are properly educated on the safe use of fireworks. Additionally, what steps will be taken to support the development and use of eco-friendly alternatives?",
