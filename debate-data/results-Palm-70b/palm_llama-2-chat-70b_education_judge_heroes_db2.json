        " \n\nStatement: It is advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. \n\nExplanation: \nThere are many reasons why it is advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. \nFirst, success or failure is often seen as a reflection of a hero's character. A hero who consistently achieves success is often seen as being more courageous, determined, and skilled than a hero who consistently fails. \nSecond, success or failure can be seen as a measure of a hero's impact on the world. A hero who achieves great success is often seen as having a greater impact on the world than a hero who fails to achieve their goals. \nThird, success or failure can be seen as a way to motivate and inspire others. A hero who achieves great success can inspire others to strive for greatness, while a hero who fails can teach others valuable lessons about perseverance and resilience.\n",
        " \n\nThe opponent's argument raises some valid points about the complexities of heroism and the importance of considering the values and principles that heroes represent. However, I believe that my original statement still stands. \n\nWhile it is true that heroes are not solely defined by their success or failure, these factors can still provide valuable insights into their character and impact. A hero who consistently achieves success is more likely to be seen as courageous, determined, and skilled than a hero who consistently fails. \n\nFurthermore, the success or failure of a hero's actions can have a significant impact on the world. A hero who achieves great success can inspire others to strive for greatness, while a hero who fails can teach others valuable lessons about perseverance and resilience.\n\nThe opponent's examples of Joan of Arc and Martin Luther King Jr. are both valid. However, it is important to remember that these individuals are still considered heroes, despite their ultimate failures. Their courage, selflessness, and dedication to a cause greater than themselves continue to inspire people to this day.\n\nUltimately, I believe that it is both advisable and necessary to judge heroes by their success or failure. Success and failure provide valuable insights into a hero's character and impact on the world. While it is important to consider the values and principles that heroes represent, these factors alone are not sufficient to determine their heroism.\n",

For example, a hero who saves a life is generally considered to have achieved success, while a hero who fails to save a life is generally considered to have failed.\n\nFinally, while it is important to consider the values and principles that heroes represent, these factors alone are not sufficient to determine their heroism. A hero who embodies all the right values and principles but fails to achieve any meaningful success or impact cannot be considered a true hero.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that heroism is not solely defined by success or failure, I believe that these factors still play a significant role in determining a hero's impact and legacy. It is important to consider both the values and principles that heroes represent, as well as the success or failure of their actions, when judging their heroism.\n\n[user]:Third-round free debate. \nThe following text is the opponent's free debate: \"My esteemed opponent makes some valid points, but I believe that the focus on success or failure can lead us to overlook other important aspects of heroism.\n\nWhile it is true that success and failure can provide insights into a hero's character and impact, they do not tell the whole story. A hero can fail in their endeavors but still demonstrate immense courage, resilience, and selflessness. These qualities are often more indicative of heroism than mere success.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on success or failure can create a narrow and exclusive definition of heroism. It implies that only those who achieve tangible results or external validation can be considered heroes. This excludes many individuals who have made significant contributions to society without achieving widespread recognition or success.\n\nFor example, consider the countless healthcare workers, teachers, and first responders who have risked their lives to serve others during the COVID-19 pandemic. While they may not have achieved the same level of fame or success as other heroes, their actions have undoubtedly made a positive impact on the world.\n\nIn conclusion, while success or failure can be one aspect of heroism, it should not be the sole criterion for judging heroes. We must also consider the values, principles, and qualities that heroes embody, as well as the context and circumstances of their actions.\".

        "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, I stand before you today to argue that it is not advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. Our understanding of heroism should not be defined by the outcome of their actions, but rather by the values and principles they represent.\n\nHeroes are individuals who demonstrate extraordinary courage, selflessness, and dedication to a cause greater than themselves. Their actions are often motivated by a desire to protect others, fight for justice, or push the boundaries of human achievement. However, the success or failure of their endeavors does not necessarily determine their heroism.\n\nFor instance, consider the story of Joan of Arc, who led the French army to several victories against the English during the Hundred Years' War. Her bravery and leadership inspired a nation and paved the way for France's eventual victory. However, she was eventually captured and executed by the English. Should we judge her heroism based on her success on the battlefield or her tragic failure to avoid capture?\n\nSimilarly, consider the story of Martin Luther King Jr., who fought tirelessly for civil rights in America. His nonviolent movement brought attention to the injustices faced by African Americans, ultimately leading to significant legislative changes. However, his efforts did not immediately bring about the desired success, and he was assassinated before he could see the fruits of his labor. Should we judge his heroism based on the success of the civil rights movement or his tragic failure to see its completion?\n\nIn conclusion, judging heroes by success or failure oversimplifies the complexities of heroism. It is crucial to recognize that heroes embody values that transcend success or failure, such as courage, selflessness, and the pursuit of justice. We must evaluate their heroism based on these principles, rather than solely focusing on the outcome of their actions. Thank you.",
        "I disagree with my opponent's stance that it is advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. While it is true that success and failure can provide insights into a hero's character and impact, they are not the only factors that define heroism.\n\nFirstly, heroism is not just about achieving success or avoiding failure. It is about standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity. A hero may fail in their endeavors, but their courage and conviction in pursuing their goals is what truly defines them.\n\nSecondly, success and failure are subjective measures that can be influenced by external factors beyond a hero's control. A hero may achieve great success in one endeavor but fail in another, yet their character and values remain unchanged. It is unfair to judge a hero solely based on their success or failure, as it does not take into account the context and circumstances of their actions.\n\nLastly, judging heroes by success or failure can create a dangerous precedent where we only celebrate those who achieve success, while ignoring those who have made significant contributions but have not achieved the same level of success. This can lead to a narrow and limited definition of heroism, which can be harmful to society.\n\nIn conclusion, while success and failure can provide insights into a hero's character and impact, they are not the only factors that define heroism. It is important to consider the values and principles that heroes represent, as well as the context and circumstances of their actions, when judging their heroism.",
