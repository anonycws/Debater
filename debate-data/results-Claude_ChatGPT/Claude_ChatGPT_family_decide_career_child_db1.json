        " Here is a possible debate response:  \n\nGood afternoon everyone. The topic of today's debate is an interesting one: Should parents decide which career their children will pursue? I am taking the stance that parents should decide which career their children will pursue.  \n\nParents know their children better than anyone else and want what is best for them. Parents have more life experience and wisdom that allows them to see opportunities and job prospects that their kids may miss. Choosing a career is a big decision that impacts the rest of one's life, so having a  parent's guidance and input can be invaluable. Allowing children complete freedom in career choice may lead to mistakes that parents could have helped avoid. With loving advice rooted in experience, parents can steer their children toward careers that suit their personalities, strengths, interests and values, setting them up for greater success and fulfilment. \n\nIn summary, by taking an active role in their children's career choice, parents can provide crucial wisdom, insight and advice that, if heeded respectfully, may help children avoid pitfalls and find careers that are the best match for who they truly are. That is why I feel parents should have a say in their children's chosen career path.",
        " Here is a 117 word response:\n\nWhile parental support and guidance are important, I believe that parents are ultimately best positioned to decide a good fit career for their children.   \n\nYou argue children must choose for motivation and fulfilment, but many teenagers lack the experience and perspective to identify a suitable career. Parents can advise on opportunities, risks and values that shape a meaningful and successful career path. Giving children complete freedom risks regrettable decisions out of short-term interests.     \n\nWith loving but firm guidance rooted in wisdom, parents can steer their children towards a purposeful career that aligns with their skills and personality, minimizing future difficulties. Open communication can alleviate potential resentment.   \n\nThe parent-child relationship evolves as children mature. While enabling more autonomy over time, wise parents retain influence where it counts: shaping the foundation for their children's future success and happiness through a sensible first career choice.",
        "  Here is a 140 word response:\n\nWhile parental support and guidance are important, I believe parents are best positioned to choose a suitable first career for their children due to:\n\n1) Youthful passions often change. Parents can advise on opportunities and values that shape a meaningful long-term career.   \n\n2) Children lack the wisdom to consider risks, opportunities and personality-fit that parents provide through experience.   \n \n3) Forcing a choice risks regrettable decisions made from limited perspective and information.   \n\n4) With open communication, parents can reduce resentment while ensuring children enter adulthood with a sensible foundation for future changes in direction.\n\nYou argue children need freedom for motivation. However, motivation depends more on match with skills/interests, which wise parental guidance can foster.   \n\nResentment often stems from dictating a path, not advising one. Parents who cultivate unconditional love and trust enable children to find their own direction within a sensible funnel set in youth.\n\nIn summary, while listening to children's perspectives, parents must also provide the wisdom that only experience and decades of investment in their children's wellbeing can offer.",
        " I understand your perspective that children should have freedom to explore their own interests and make their own career choices. However, I still believe that parents have an important role to play in guiding their children's career decisions, especially at a young age.  \n\nWhile parental guidance may sometimes limit a child's freedom, it also provides needed structure, wisdom and values that help children make choices aligned with their long-term well-being. Parents who steer their children toward careers they deem worthwhile, stable and aligned with the child's talents are acting in the child's best interests.\n\nWhile children's interests may change, parents can help them explore a wide range of options and continuously reevaluate their plans. Simply allowing a child to pursue any whimsical passion may not lead to a stable, fulfilling career.\n\nLastly, open and honest dialogue between parent and child that explores the child's true interests within the context of the parent's values and wisdom can maximize the child's motivation and fulfillment while minimizing resentment. Ultimately, a balance must be found between freedom and guidance that considers the child's stage of development.\n\nIn summary, while children's own choices are important, especially as they mature, parental guidance remains essential to align their choices with their long-term well-being and development. Open communication within a framework of love, wisdom and trust can minimize resentment while maximizing the child's chances for a fulfilling future.",
        "  While you make some good points about the value of children exploring their own interests and passions, I still believe parents have an important role to play in guiding their children's career choices in a sensible and balanced way.  \n\nYou suggest that allowing children complete freedom to choose their own career will lead to greater motivation and fulfillment, but this overlooks the benefit of parental wisdom and advice in helping children make choices aligned with their long-term potential and the realities of the job market. Simply following one's passions may not lead to a stable, meaningful career.\n\nWhile parental guidance can sometimes limit a child's freedom, caring parents aim to balance freedom with structure, wisdom and values that serve the child's development. Open, honest communication within the context of a loving relationship can minimize resentment while maximizing the child's chances for a suitable career.\n\nIn short, the ideal approach is not to \"leave the decision up to the child\" nor to force a particular career choice upon a child against their will, but rather to provide guidance, wisdom and options within a framework of open communication, trust and care. Both parental influence and each child's unique interests have important roles to play in career choice.\n\nIn summary, while children's own choices are important, parental understanding, advice and gentle nudging remain essential to align those choices with the child's long-term welfare and potential. Wisdom, love and trust between parent and child are the keys to the best outcome."

        "As the negative side, I believe that parents should not decide which career their children will pursue. While parents may have good intentions, ultimately it is the child who will be living and working in their chosen career for the rest of their lives. It is important for children to have the freedom to explore their own interests and passions, and to make their own decisions about their future. By allowing children to choose their own career path, they will be more motivated and invested in their work, leading to greater success and fulfillment in their lives. Additionally, forcing a child into a career they do not enjoy can lead to resentment and a strained relationship between parent and child. Therefore, it is crucial for parents to support and guide their children, but ultimately allow them to make their own decisions about their future careers.",
        "Thank you for your response. While I agree that parental guidance and support are important, I believe that ultimately the decision of which career to pursue should be left up to the child. \n\nFirstly, children have their own unique interests and passions that may not align with their parents' ideas of what is best for them. By allowing children to choose their own career path, they are more likely to be motivated and invested in their work, leading to greater success and fulfillment in their lives. \n\nSecondly, forcing a child into a career they do not enjoy can lead to resentment and a strained relationship between parent and child.
