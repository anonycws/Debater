        " Respected chairperson and my esteemed colleague,\n\nWomen do need more care and attention than men for several biological, social and psychological reasons.\n\nBiologically, women have a more complex reproductive system that requires regular checkups and care. They go through challenges like menstruation, pregnancy and menopause which impact their health and wellbeing in unique ways. All this necessitates more medical care for women.   \n\nSocially, women often bear the double burden of work and household responsibilities. They have to juggle their jobs and careers with caregiving duties of children and elders. This imbalance puts extra pressure on women, heightening their need for support.\n\nPsychologically, women are more prone to certain mental health issues like depression, anxiety and eating disorders. They also face challenges of body image, self-esteem and gender bias which men do not. All this calls for greater mental care for women.\n\nIn summary, due to biological differences, unequal division of labor and unique psychological pressures, women do need and deserve more care and support than men. I rest my case here and look forward to answering any questions and concerns you may have.",
        " I understand the negative side's concern for providing adequate care and support for men. However, legalizing euthanasia for terminally ill individuals would not disadvantage or prevent care for vulnerable groups like men facing health issues. Properly regulated, euthanasia would simply provide an end-of-life choice for those experiencing unbearable suffering from physical and mental deterioration caused by an incurable disease. \n\nWhile men and women face different challenges that deserve solutions, legalizing assisted dying for the gravely ill would not impede efforts to address health disparities between sexes or neglect priorities of men's health. Instead, choice at the end of life for those facing unbearable agony would provide true compassion and dignity - values we should strive to offer all people, regardless of sex or illness. Does the negative side disagree that terminally ill individuals enduring hopeless suffering deserve the option of a peaceful, aided death alongside other efforts to improve care for at-risk groups like men facing health issues?",
        " You raise some valid concerns about risks associated with legalizing euthanasia. However, I believe these risks can be effectively managed through strict eligibility requirements, safeguards, and oversight. While there are always edge cases, the primary goal should be meeting the needs of terminally ill patients who are suffering intolerably with no hope of improvement.\n\nFor the vast majority of chronic or disabled patients, improved care and support would vastly outweigh any desire for hastened death. Legalizing aid in dying for a small subset of gravely ill patients would not divert important resources from improving palliative care overall. In fact, studies show legalization does not affect use of hospice or palliative care.  \n\nDoes the negative side agree that ideally, no terminally ill patient should want euthanasia - they should receive optimal comfort care to alleviate suffering? However, for the few who will inevitably face hopeless agony  despite our best efforts, choice at life's end remains a compassionate option when safeguarded carefully? We should pursue multiple goals that reduce the need for assisted dying while respecting personal autonomy for those who need it most.",
        " You make some fair points about potential risks with legalizing euthanasia. Improving end-of-life care must remain a higher priority to minimize the need for assisted dying, and we should certainly address root causes of suffering like isolation and poverty.\n\nHowever, I believe focusing only on improving comfort care ignores the minority of patients who continue to experience irreversible, intolerable suffering despite receiving excellent palliative measures. For these individuals, prioritizing compassion means honoring their personal choice to achieve a peaceful death with dignity when prolonged life holds no value.   \n\nWhile no system is perfect, does the negative side agree that if legalized with strict safeguards and oversight, euthanasia: 1) Would remain a last resort option after all treatment and comfort options are exhausted for truly eligible patients 2) Could coexist alongside broader efforts to improve palliative care and social supports 3) Would ultimately reflect our shared societal values of autonomy, compassion  and prevention of needless suffering?  \n\nGranting individuals choice at life's end when reasonable measures have failed need not devalue life nor negatively impact society as a whole - it can demonstrate how we strive as a community to minimize suffering for all its members at every stage.",
        " The negative side argues that legalizing assisted dying would send a negative message and have unintended consequences, especially for vulnerable groups like the chronically ill and disabled. Instead of euthanasia, we should focus on improving palliative care, pain management, and addressing root causes of suffering.  \n\nWhile quality end-of-life care must remain a priority, I believe legalizing assisted dying with strict safeguards could reflect our values of compassion and autonomy for individuals who need it most. For the small minority who continue suffering irreversibly, euthanasia grants choice at life's end alongside broader efforts to improve care. With proper policies, it need not devalue life or negatively impact society, but show how we strive to minimize needless suffering for all members - including vulnerable groups -  at every stage. Does the negative side agree that if eligibility  criteria were sufficiently narrow and safeguards robust, assisted dying could coexist with efforts to improve care and support for the chronically ill and disabled?"

        "As the negative side, I believe that men need more care than women. This is because men are often expected to be strong and independent, which can lead to neglecting their own physical and mental health. Men are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse and dangerous sports, which can lead to injuries and health problems. Additionally, men are often the primary breadwinners in families and may face more stress and pressure in their careers. Therefore, it is important to provide men with the necessary care and support to maintain their health and well-being. This does not mean that women do not need care, but rather that men should not be overlooked in discussions about healthcare and support.",
        "Thank you for your argument, but I must respectfully disagree. Legalizing euthanasia for terminally ill individuals could have unintended consequences for vulnerable groups, including men facing health issues. It could create a slippery slope where euthanasia is extended to other groups beyond the terminally ill, such as those with chronic illnesses or disabilities. This could lead to a devaluation of the lives of those who are deemed \"less worthy\" of care and support.\n\nFurthermore, legalizing euthanasia could divert resources away from improving palliative care and other end-of-life options that prioritize comfort and dignity for patients. It is important to focus on improving care for all individuals, including men facing health issues, rather than offering a quick fix solution that could have negative consequences.\n\nIn terms of your question, I believe that terminally ill individuals should have access to compassionate end-of-life care, including palliative care and pain management. However, I do not believe that legalizing euthanasia is the best solution for addressing the needs of those facing unbearable suffering. We should prioritize improving care and support for all individuals, regardless of their sex or illness.",
