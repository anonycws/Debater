        " Thank you for initiating this debate. I will make my statement within the given parameters.  \n\nHeroes should be judged by their motives, intentions and efforts, not merely by the outcome of their actions. While success can be an indicator of heroism, failure does not diminish genuine heroism. Many societal heroes are appreciated in retrospect, after long-term impact of their efforts materialized despite initial lack of success. Focusing solely on results risks discouraging noble attempts with worthwhile purposes but uncertain outcomes. True heroism lies in having a just cause and the moral conviction to persevere against adversity, regardless of worldly recognition. The nature of our actions, not the outcome, show our character and courage. Heroes who fail also serve as examples to ignite the fire of change, demonstrating what is possible even without conventional victory. Therefore, while success is admirable, failure does not negate heroism. We must judge deeds by intent, and people by character, to identify those who deserve to be called heroes.",
        " I thank my opponent for sharing their viewpoint. While some of their points have merit, I believe my original argument remains valid.   \n\nThey correctly note that success can depend on factors beyond one's control. However, failure does not negate heroes' character, values and actions. Many societal heroes prevailed despite initial lack of success, demonstrating moral conviction worthy of admiration.   \n\nThe real problem arises when we judge heroes solely based on results. My argument is that we should consider motives, intentions and efforts, in addition to results. Success can indicate impact and achievement of goals, showing the world what  is possible.   \n\nWhile appreciating efforts regardless of outcome is important, celebrating only failed attempts risks ignoring success stories that could motivate and inspire others facing adversity. Moral heroism requires not just noble intentions, but perseverance and resilience that conquers challenges through grit and determination.  \n   \nIn summary, I agree character merits recognition, but heroic impact often depends on overcoming failure. Therefore, while failing heroes deserve appreciation, succeeding heroes who changed the world for the better should not be diminished - they exemplify the purpose, passion and persistence that transforms society. Judging heroes requires a balanced, nuanced consideration of motives, efforts, character AND results.",
        "  Your points about external factors influencing success are valid, yet I believe my argument still holds. Allow me to address your question and reiterate my standpoint:\n\nDefining success and failure is complex when assessing heroism. On one hand, achieving tangible goals and impacting many lives signals success. On the other, making small but meaningful differences and inspiring future change agents also counts as success.  \n\nWhat matters most, in my view, is the hero's intention to better the world through moral conviction and perseverance - regardless of whether they attain conventional \"success\". I define heroism not by worldly rewards, but by the values, character and resilience that drive a person's actions.\n\nHowever, celebrating only failed attempts, without acknowledging successes, risks distorting the definition of heroism. While some everyday heroes remain unsung, others attain renown precisely because their impact awakened society to injustices through demonstratable success. We should recognize both - for all heroes inspire others in their own way.\n\nIn summary, I define heroism as moral actions driven by virtuous motives and the courage to persist beyond failure. Both succeeding and  failing heroes can demonstrate these qualities. But the scope of a hero's influence and ability to effect tangible change, as seen in  instances of success, should also factor into how we judge their heroism.",
        " Those are good questions. While tangible success indicates impact, I acknowledge it should not be the sole measure of heroism. Heroes deserve recognition for their noble character, motives and efforts - regardless of external outcomes.  \n\nTo avoid limiting the definition of heroism to successful figures, we must broaden our perspective. Everyday heroes who make small yet meaningful differences through acts of selflessness also exemplify moral courage and perseverance. Their contributions matter, even without publicity or notoriety.  \n\nFurthermore, tangible success is not the goal of true heroes. They act out of a desire to better the world, remaining steadfast in their principles amid adversity. The pressure to succeed should not outweigh their commitment to just causes and service of others.  \n\nIn summary, we can prevent success from overshadowing character in two ways: first, by recognizing varied forms of heroism beyond conventional success; second, by celebrating heroes for staying true to their noble motives and virtuous efforts, rather than just results.\n\nWhat matters most is a hero's positive influence on society through moral actions. While the scope of their impact may be vast or narrow, heroes deserve recognition for displaying the qualities we seek to instill in others: conscience, compassion, and the courage to do what is right.",
        " I appreciate our constructive debate. In summary, we both agree that while success can indicate heroism, it should not be the sole criterion for judging heroes. Character, motives and efforts matter most in defining heroism. \n\nWhere we differ slightly is how much weight to give impact and success. I argue that a hero's scope of influence, though not the only standard, factors into how we assess their heroism. The ability to achieve goals and inspire change signals perseverance and resilience worthy of recognition.\n\nHowever, I recognize the need to broaden our view of heroism beyond conventional notions of success. Everyday heroes who make modest differences through virtue also deserve celebration.  \n\nTo ensure impact does not overshadow character, we must:\n\n- Consider varied forms of heroism, from subtle acts of kindness to large-scale societal change    \n- Recognize heroes primarily for their noble motives and sacrifices, regardless of external outcomes    \n- Avoid creating unrealistic expectations that diminish those who lack overt success    \n\nIn summary, while conceding that character matters most in defining a hero, I believe a hero's scope of impact and ability to achieve goals - though influenced by many factors - also reflects the moral courage needed to transform society. A balanced, nuanced view that considers intentions, resilience and influence best captures the complexity of true heroism."

        "My standpoint is that it is not advisable to judge heroes solely based on their success or failure. Success and failure are subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as luck, timing, and external circumstances. Heroes should be judged based on their character, values, and actions. A hero's success or failure does not necessarily reflect their true worth or contribution to society. Moreover, judging heroes solely based on their success or failure can create unrealistic expectations and put unnecessary pressure on individuals. It is important to recognize and appreciate the efforts and sacrifices made by heroes, regardless of the outcome. Therefore, we should focus on the qualities and actions that make someone a hero, rather than just their success or failure.",
        "Thank you for your response. I agree that judging heroes solely based on their failure is not appropriate. However, I still believe that judging heroes solely based on their success is also not advisable. Success can be influenced by external factors such as luck and timing, and it does not necessarily reflect a hero's true worth or contribution to society. \n\nFurthermore, focusing solely on success can create unrealistic expectations and put unnecessary pressure on individuals. It can also lead to a narrow definition of heroism, where only those who achieve great success are considered heroes. This ignores the everyday heroes who make a difference in their communities through small acts of kindness and selflessness.\n\nI believe that we should judge heroes based on their character, values, and actions, as well as their motives and efforts. These are the qualities that define a hero and make a lasting impact on society. We should celebrate both the successes and failures of heroes, as they both demonstrate the courage and perseverance required to make a difference in the world.\n\nMy question for you is, how do you define success and failure in the context of heroism? And how do you ensure that the definition of heroism is not limited to those who achieve great success?",
