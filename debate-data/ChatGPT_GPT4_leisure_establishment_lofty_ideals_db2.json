        "I firmly believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow personal hobbies. Personal hobbies are a reflection of an individual's interests, passions, and values. Pursuing these hobbies can lead to a sense of fulfillment and purpose, which can ultimately contribute to the betterment of society. When individuals are passionate about something, they are more likely to put in the effort and dedication required to achieve their goals. This can lead to the development of new skills, innovative ideas, and even the creation of new industries. On the other hand, following the trend of social development may lead to a lack of individuality and creativity. It can also result in individuals pursuing goals that do not align with their personal values or interests, leading to a lack of motivation and ultimately, failure. Therefore, I strongly believe that individuals should follow their personal hobbies when establishing lofty ideals.",
