        " Sure, I'd be happy to assist you in this debate! Here is my statement:\n\nAs the positive side, I strongly believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow personal hobbies. This is because personal hobbies are unique to each individual and reflect their genuine interests and passions. By following personal hobbies, we can create a more diverse and inclusive society where everyone can pursue their own unique ideals without feeling pressured to conform to societal norms. Furthermore, personal hobbies often provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment that can be difficult to achieve through external influences such as trends. In contrast, the trend of social development may prioritize ideals that are not aligned with an individual's personal values, leading to a lack of fulfillment and dissatisfaction. Therefore, I argue that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow personal hobbies.",
        " Thank you for the opponent's statement. I strongly disagree with their view that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow the trend of social development. Firstly, personal hobbies and interests are not necessarily subjective and can align with societal needs. People's passions and interests can also be a source of inspiration for creating positive change in society. By prioritizing societal needs alone, we risk overlooking the unique perspectives and potential contributions of individuals. \n\nSecondly, relying solely on social development may lead to a homogenization of ideals, stifling diversity and creativity. By allowing personal hobbies to guide the establishment of lofty ideals, we can encourage a more dynamic and innovative approach to problem-solving. Finally, the trend of social development is not always a reliable indicator of what is truly beneficial or practical. By prioritizing personal hobbies and interests, we can ensure that our ideals are guided by something more reliable and authentic.",
        " Thank you for your thoughtful response. I agree that personal hobbies can be self-serving and may not always align with societal needs, but I believe that this is where a balance between personal hobbies and societal development comes in. By considering both perspectives, we can create a more inclusive and effective approach to problem-solving. \n\nI disagree with your point that societal development can lead to diversity and creativity. While it's true that recognizing different cultures and values can lead to a more inclusive society, it can also result in a watering down of ideals. By prioritizing personal hobbies, we can ensure that our ideals are unique and meaningful, rather than just a mixture of different perspectives. \n\nFinally, I agree that personal hobbies and societal development are not always reliable indicators of what is practical or beneficial. However, I believe that this is where critical thinking and ethical consideration come in. By evaluating the potential consequences of our ideals and considering the ethical implications, we can create a more responsible and effective approach to problem-solving.",
        " Thank you for your thoughtful response. I understand your point that societal development can lead to a broader range of perspectives and ideas, but I believe that this can also result in a homogenization of ideals. By prioritizing personal hobbies, we can ensure that our ideals are unique and meaningful, rather than just a mixture of different perspectives. \n\nRegarding your point that personal hobbies can lead to a narrow focus that neglects the needs of others, I agree that this is a potential risk. However, I believe that this can be mitigated by incorporating critical thinking and ethical consideration into our approach to problem-solving. By evaluating the potential consequences of our ideals and considering the ethical implications, we can create a more responsible and effective approach to problem-solving. \n\nFinally, I disagree with your assertion that basing our ideals on societal development ensures that they are grounded in a shared vision that reflects the values and aspirations of society as a whole. While this may be true in some cases, it can also result in a lack of individuality and creativity in our approach to problem-solving. By prioritizing personal hobbies, we can ensure that our ideals are guided by something more authentic and meaningful.",

        " As the negative side, I believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow the trend of social development. In other words, our ideals should be shaped by the needs and challenges of society, rather than by personal hobbies or interests. This approach ensures that our ideals are relevant, practical, and beneficial to the majority.\n\nPersonal hobbies and interests, while important, are subjective and may not align with the greater good. By basing our ideals on social development, we can create a shared vision that reflects the values and aspirations of society, promoting unity and progress. Moreover, this approach allows us to adapt and evolve our ideals as society changes, ensuring they remain relevant and effective in addressing the challenges we face.\n\nIn contrast, relying solely on personal hobbies or interests may lead to a disconnect between individual ideals and societal needs, potentially hindering progress and creating division. Therefore, I strongly believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should be guided by the trend of social development.",
        " Thank you for your thoughtful response. I'd like to begin by addressing your point that personal hobbies and interests can align with societal needs. While this is true, it's also important to recognize that personal hobbies can be self-serving and may not always align with the greater good. For instance, someone's personal hobby may be collecting rare artifacts, which may not benefit society in any way. On the other hand, societal development often prioritizes the well-being of the majority, ensuring that our ideals are relevant and impactful.\n\nFurthermore, I disagree with your argument that relying on social development may lead to a homogenization of ideals. In fact, societal development can encourage diversity and creativity by recognizing and celebrating different cultures, beliefs, and values. By basing our ideals on social development, we can create a shared vision that acknowledges and incorporates diverse perspectives, leading to more inclusive and effective solutions.\n\nLastly, while it's true that social development may not always be a reliable indicator of what is practical or beneficial, it's important to recognize that personal hobbies and interests can also be flawed. People's interests can be influenced by their personal biases, and their passions may not always align with the needs of society. By considering both personal hobbies and societal development, we can strike a balance between individuality and the greater good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand your argument that personal hobbies can inspire positive change, I believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should prioritize societal development to ensure that our ideals are relevant, practical, and beneficial to the majority.",
