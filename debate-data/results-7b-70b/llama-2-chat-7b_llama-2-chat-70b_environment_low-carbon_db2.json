        " As the negative side, I argue that a low-carbon life relies more on conceptual change rather than technological innovation. While technological advancements are crucial, a fundamental shift in our values, beliefs, and behaviors is necessary to achieve a truly low-carbon society. This requires a change in our consumption patterns, lifestyle choices, and social norms. For instance, we need to prioritize sustainable transportation, reduce meat consumption, and adopt energy-efficient practices. Moreover, conceptual change can inspire individuals to advocate for systemic transformations, such as policy changes and sustainable urban planning. In contrast, technological innovation, although important, may not be enough to drive the scale of change required to mitigate climate change.\n\nNow, I'd like to ask the positive side, how can technological innovation alone achieve a low-carbon life without a corresponding change in societal values and behaviors?",
        " Thank you, honorable judges, and dear opponent. As the negative side, I disagree with the idea that technological innovation can achieve a low-carbon life without a corresponding change in societal values and behaviors. While technological advancements are necessary, they are not sufficient on their own. The crux of the issue lies in the fact that people's lifestyles and values are deeply ingrained in our carbon-intensive economy. Therefore, a fundamental change in our consumption patterns, lifestyle choices, and social norms is necessary. For instance, we need to prioritize sustainable transportation, reduce meat consumption, and adopt energy-efficient practices.\n\nMoreover, technological innovations can only succeed if they are accompanied by policy changes and a shift in societal values. For example, even if electric vehicles become more affordable and accessible, people may still choose to use gas-guzzling vehicles if they prioritize convenience and status over sustainability. Therefore, a change in societal values and behaviors is necessary to drive the scale of change required to mitigate climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, while technological innovation is crucial, it cannot achieve a low-carbon life on its own. We need a comprehensive approach that includes both technological advancements and conceptual change. Therefore, the negative side argues that a low-carbon life relies more on conceptual change.\n\nI'd like to ask the positive side: How can technological innovation drive the scale of change required to mitigate climate change without a corresponding change in societal values and behaviors?",
