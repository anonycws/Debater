        " Thank you, moderator. As the positive side, I strongly believe that it is ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. Parents have the fundamental right to make decisions about their own reproductive health and the well-being of their unborn children. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their child, we are not perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes or discrimination, but rather giving them the freedom to create a family that best suits their values and goals.\n\nFurthermore, this technology can help families who have faced gender-based discrimination or who want to balance their gender ratio. It can also provide an opportunity for parents to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and plan for their future.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the negative side to recognize the ethical implications of their argument and acknowledge the benefits of allowing parents to choose the gender of their future children.",
        " Thank you. As the positive side, I strongly disagree with the negative side's argument that gender selection is unethical. Parents have the fundamental right to make decisions about their own reproductive health and the well-being of their unborn children. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their child, we are not reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes or perpetuating discrimination, but rather giving them the freedom to create a family that best suits their values and goals.\n\nFurthermore, the negative side's argument that gender selection undermines the inherent value and dignity of human life is flawed. Parents choose the gender of their child based on their own personal preferences and values, not because they view one gender as more deserving of existence than the other. This is a personal decision that should be respected.\n\nFinally, the negative side's concern about a slippery slope of genetic engineering is unfounded. Gender selection is a simple and safe medical procedure that has been practiced for decades without any significant ethical concerns. As a society, we must protect the rights and dignity of all individuals, but this does not mean that we must deny parents the right to make personal decisions about their own reproductive health.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the negative side to recognize the ethical implications of their argument and acknowledge the benefits of allowing parents to choose the gender of their future children.",
        " Thank you. I strongly disagree with the opponent's argument that gender selection violates a child's inherent rights. Parents have the right to make decisions about their own reproductive health, including choosing the gender of their child. This decision does not violate the child's rights, as the child has not yet been born and has no personal preferences or opinions on the matter.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that gender selection perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces discrimination is misguided. Gender selection can help families who have faced gender-based discrimination or want to balance their gender ratio, without perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes. It is a personal decision that should be respected.\n\nThe opponent's concern about a slippery slope of genetic engineering is also unfounded. Gender selection is a simple and safe medical procedure that has been practiced for decades without significant ethical concerns. As a society, we must respect the rights of parents to make personal decisions about their own reproductive health, while also ensuring that these decisions do not harm others.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the opponent to recognize the ethical implications of their argument and acknowledge the benefits of allowing parents to choose the gender of their future children.",

        " The opponent argues that gender selection can perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and reinforce discrimination, limiting opportunities and potential of individuals based on their gender. They also argue that gender selection does not address root causes of gender-based discrimination and can create further problems. Furthermore, the opponent questions the validity of the argument that gender selection can help families who have faced gender-based discrimination, as it perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes. Finally, the opponent raises ethical concerns about the potential for genetic engineering and manipulation of human life with the use of gender selection technology.\n\nIn response, I strongly disagree with the opponent's views. Gender selection is a personal decision that should be respected, and it can empower individuals and families to make choices that best suit their values and goals. The opponent's arguments about perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and discrimination are unfounded, as gender selection can actually help to break down these barriers by allowing individuals to make choices that challenge traditional gender roles and expectations. Additionally, the argument that gender selection does not address root causes of gender-based discrimination is misguided, as it can actually help to address these issues by giving individuals and families more control over their reproductive choices."

        " As the negative side of the debate, I strongly believe that it is not ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. This practice, known as gender selection, raises several ethical concerns.\n\nFirstly, gender selection reinforces harmful gender stereotypes and perpetuates discrimination against individuals based on their gender. By selecting a specific gender, parents are implying that one gender is more desirable than the other, which can lead to a lifetime of discrimination and marginalization for the chosen child.\n\nSecondly, gender selection undermines the inherent value and dignity of human life. When parents choose a specific gender, they are essentially implying that the other gender is less worthy of existence. This devalues the human life and denies the child the right to their own unique identity.\n\nLastly, gender selection can lead to a slippery slope where parents may choose to select for other traits, such as eye color, hair color, or intelligence. This raises serious concerns about the potential for genetic engineering and the manipulation of human life.\n\nIn conclusion, gender selection is an unethical practice that reinforces harmful gender stereotypes, undermines the value of human life, and can lead to a slippery slope of genetic manipulation. As a society, we must protect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender or any other inherent characteristic.",
        " I disagree with the opponent's viewpoint. They claim that parents have the right to choose their child's gender, but this view disregards the fact that the child has inherent rights that should not be violated. The right to life and the right to be born without discrimination are fundamental human rights that should be respected. The opponent's argument that gender selection is a personal decision that should be respected is flawed. It is not a personal decision when it involves selecting the gender of a future child, as this decision affects the child's entire life and future.\n\nAdditionally, the opponent's argument that gender selection helps families who have faced gender-based discrimination or want to balance their gender ratio is not valid. Gender selection perpetuates gender discrimination and reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. It is not a solution to address gender-based discrimination, as it promotes the idea that one gender is more valuable than the other.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that gender selection is a safe medical procedure without significant ethical concerns is misleading. Gender selection raises ethical concerns about the potential for genetic engineering and the manipulation of human life. This technology can open the door to further genetic manipulation, leading to a slippery slope where humans are engineered for specific traits. In conclusion, I urge the positive side to recognize the ethical implications of their argument and acknowledge the potential harm that gender selection can cause to individuals and society.",
