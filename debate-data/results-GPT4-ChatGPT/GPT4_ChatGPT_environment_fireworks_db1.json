        "As the positive side, we firmly believe that we should limit setting off fireworks. Our stance is based on three primary reasons: public safety, environmental impact, and noise pollution. Fireworks, when not handled properly, can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. Additionally, fireworks contribute to air pollution, releasing harmful chemicals and particulate matter into the atmosphere, which can have detrimental effects on both human health and the environment. Lastly, the noise generated by fireworks can cause significant distress to individuals, particularly those with sensory sensitivities, as well as to pets and wildlife. By limiting the use of fireworks, we can mitigate these risks and work towards a safer, cleaner, and more inclusive society.",
        "While we acknowledge the cultural significance of fireworks and the joy they bring, we must also consider the negative consequences they pose. The argument that fireworks have been used for centuries without significant harm is not entirely accurate. Fireworks-related accidents and injuries have been reported throughout history, and with the increasing availability of fireworks, these incidents have become more common. Proper education and regulation are essential, but limiting the use of fireworks can be an effective part of that regulation.\n\nFurthermore, the environmental impact and noise pollution caused by fireworks cannot be ignored. The harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere contribute to air pollution, which affects human health and the environment. The noise generated by fireworks can be distressing for individuals with sensory sensitivities, pets, and wildlife. We argue that finding alternative ways to celebrate our cultural traditions without causing harm is a more responsible approach.",
        "We appreciate your suggestions on education and regulation, but we maintain that limiting the use of fireworks is a necessary component of a comprehensive approach to addressing the issues they pose.\n\nRegarding public safety, even with proper education, accidents can still occur due to human error or unforeseen circumstances. Limiting the use of fireworks would reduce the overall risk of such incidents.\n\nWhile eco-friendly fireworks are a step in the right direction, they are not yet widely available or affordable for most consumers. Limiting fireworks usage would still help reduce the overall environmental impact.\n\nAs for noise pollution, even if it is temporary and limited to specific times of the year, it can still cause significant distress to individuals, pets, and wildlife. Limiting fireworks usage would help alleviate this issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while education and regulation are essential, they alone are not sufficient. Limiting the use of fireworks is a crucial part of ensuring public safety, environmental protection, and noise reduction.",
        "We understand your concerns about illegal usage of fireworks, but we argue that a well-implemented limitation on fireworks, combined with education and regulation, would be more effective in addressing the issues they pose.\n\nRegarding public safety, limiting fireworks usage would reduce the overall number of incidents, as fewer fireworks would be available for misuse. Strict enforcement of limitations would discourage illegal usage.\n\nFor environmental impact, limiting fireworks usage would decrease the overall amount of pollution generated. As eco-friendly fireworks become more accessible, they can be incorporated into the allowed usage, further reducing the environmental impact.\n\nConcerning noise pollution, limiting fireworks usage would reduce the frequency and intensity of noise disturbances. Strict enforcement of limitations would discourage illegal and disruptive usage.\n\nIn conclusion, while education and regulation are important, they alone cannot fully address the issues posed by fireworks. Limiting their use, combined with strict enforcement, education, and regulation, would be a more comprehensive solution that still allows for the cultural significance and joy of fireworks in a safer and more responsible manner.",
        "In summary, while our opponent believes that education and regulation alone are sufficient to address the issues posed by fireworks, we maintain that a comprehensive approach, including limiting their use, is necessary for public safety, environmental protection, and noise reduction.\n\nOur opponent's concerns about illegal usage are valid, but we argue that strict enforcement of limitations, combined with education and regulation, would discourage such behavior and lead to a safer and more responsible environment for fireworks usage.\n\nLimiting fireworks would not take away from the cultural significance and joy they bring, but rather promote a more sustainable and responsible way to celebrate. By addressing the issues of public safety, environmental impact, and noise pollution, we can ensure that fireworks remain a cherished part of our cultural celebrations while minimizing the risks and negative consequences associated with their use."

        "As the negative side, I believe that we should not limit setting off fireworks. Fireworks are an important part of cultural celebrations and bring joy and excitement to people's lives. Limiting fireworks would take away from the cultural significance of these celebrations and deprive people of the joy they bring. Additionally, fireworks have been used for centuries and have not caused significant harm to society. While there are some safety concerns, these can be addressed through proper education and regulation rather than an outright ban. Overall, the benefits of fireworks outweigh the potential risks, and limiting them would be a disservice to our cultural traditions and the happiness they bring to people's lives.",
        "Thank you for your statement. While I understand your concerns about public safety, environmental impact, and noise pollution, I believe that limiting the use of fireworks is not the best solution. Instead, we should focus on education and regulation to ensure that fireworks are used safely and responsibly.\n\nRegarding public safety, while accidents and injuries can occur, they are relatively rare and can be prevented through proper education and regulation. Limiting the use of fireworks would not necessarily prevent accidents from happening, as people may still use them illegally or without proper knowledge.\n\nAs for environmental impact, while fireworks do release harmful chemicals into the atmosphere, the amount is relatively small compared to other sources of pollution. Additionally, many fireworks manufacturers are now producing eco-friendly fireworks that have a reduced environmental impact.\n\nFinally, while noise pollution can be an issue, it is only temporary and limited to specific times of the year. People can take measures to reduce the impact on pets and wildlife, such as keeping them indoors during fireworks displays.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns about fireworks, I believe that education and regulation are the best ways to ensure their safe and responsible use. Limiting their use would take away from the cultural significance and joy they bring to people's lives.",
