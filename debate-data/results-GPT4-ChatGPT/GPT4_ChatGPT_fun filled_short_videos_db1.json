        "I believe that the popularity of short videos is a manifestation of spiritual and cultural lack. While short videos may provide entertainment and a quick escape from reality, they do not contribute to the development of one's spiritual or cultural richness. In fact, the excessive consumption of short videos can lead to a lack of attention span, a decrease in critical thinking skills, and a disconnection from the real world. Short videos often prioritize sensationalism and instant gratification over substance and depth, which can lead to a shallow understanding of important issues and a lack of empathy towards others.
