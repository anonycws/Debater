        "While it is true that young people still engage in traditional leisure activities, the prevalence of technology has undeniably altered the way they spend their leisure time. The increased screen time and reliance on digital devices have led to a decrease in outdoor activities and face-to-face interactions. Social media, although making it easier to connect with friends, has also contributed to the rise of superficial connections and a decline in meaningful relationships. Furthermore, the convenience of e-books and audiobooks has led to a decrease in physical book sales, indicating a shift in reading habits. The introduction of new forms of entertainment, such as video games and streaming services, has not only provided additional options but has also significantly impacted the time spent on traditional leisure activities. Therefore, technology has indeed changed the way young people spend their leisure time, both in terms of the activities they engage in and the manner in which they participate.",

        "As the negative side, I believe that technology has not changed the way young people spend their leisure time. While it is true that technology has become more prevalent in our daily lives, it has not fundamentally altered the way we choose to spend our free time. Young people still engage in activities such as sports, reading, and socializing with friends, just as they did before the advent of technology. In fact, technology has even made some of these activities more accessible and convenient. For example, e-books and audiobooks have made reading more accessible, and social media has made it easier to connect with friends and family. While technology may have introduced new forms of entertainment, such as video games and streaming services, these activities are simply additional options for young people to choose from, rather than a complete replacement for traditional leisure activities.",
