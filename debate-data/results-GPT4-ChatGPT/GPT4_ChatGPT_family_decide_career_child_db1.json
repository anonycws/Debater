        "As the positive side, we firmly believe that parents should decide which career their children will pursue. Our standpoint is based on the following reasons: Firstly, parents have more life experience and a better understanding of the job market, which enables them to make informed decisions for their children's future. Secondly, parents have a deep understanding of their children's strengths, weaknesses, and interests, which allows them to guide their children towards a suitable career path. Lastly, parental involvement in career decisions fosters a strong support system for the child, ensuring they have the necessary resources and encouragement to succeed in their chosen field. Overall, we argue that parents' involvement in their children's career choices is essential for their long-term success and well-being.",
        "While we acknowledge the importance of individual interests and passions, we argue that parents' guidance in career decisions is crucial for long-term success. Parents can still encourage exploration while providing valuable insights based on their life experience and understanding of the job market. This guidance can help children make informed decisions and avoid potential pitfalls in their career paths.\n\nMoreover, parental involvement does not necessarily lead to resentment or strained relationships. In fact, it can foster a strong support system, ensuring children have the necessary resources and encouragement to succeed. By working together, parents and children can find a balance between personal interests and practical considerations.\n\nLastly, motivation and investment in one's work can still be achieved with parental guidance. Parents can help their children understand the importance of commitment and hard work, regardless of the chosen career, ultimately leading to greater success and fulfillment.",
        "We understand the concerns raised by the negative side; however, we maintain that parents should play a decisive role in their children's career choices. Parental guidance does not equate to dictating their child's future but rather providing valuable insights and support.\n\nWhile the job market is constantly evolving, parents can still offer guidance based on their understanding of the child's strengths, weaknesses, and interests. This helps in identifying suitable career paths that align with both personal interests and market demands.\n\nThe power dynamic concern can be mitigated through open communication and collaboration between parents and children. By working together, they can find a balance between the child's desires and practical considerations, ensuring a well-rounded decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, parental involvement in career decisions is essential for providing a strong support system, fostering commitment, and ensuring long-term success and fulfillment in the child's chosen career.",
        "We appreciate the negative side's concerns; however, we believe that parents playing a decisive role in their children's career choices can still allow for exploration and personal growth. Parental guidance does not mean restricting children's freedom but rather offering valuable insights and support to help them make informed decisions.\n\nParents can encourage their children to explore various career paths while providing guidance based on their understanding of the child's strengths, weaknesses, and interests. This collaborative approach ensures that children are motivated and invested in their chosen careers while benefiting from their parents' experience and knowledge.\n\nDeveloping independence and self-confidence is crucial, but it can be achieved alongside parental involvement. Parents can teach their children decision-making skills and help them navigate their career paths while still allowing them to make their own choices.\n\nIn conclusion, parental involvement in career decisions is essential for providing a strong support system, fostering commitment, and ensuring long-term success and fulfillment in the child's chosen career.",

        "As the negative side, I believe that parents should not decide which career their children will pursue. While parents may have good intentions, ultimately it is the child who will be living and working in their chosen career for the rest of their lives. It is important for children to have the freedom to explore their own interests and passions, and to make their own decisions about their future. By allowing children to choose their own career path, they will be more motivated and invested in their work, leading to greater success and fulfillment in their lives. Additionally, forcing a child into a career they do not enjoy can lead to resentment and a strained relationship between parent and child. Ultimately, it is important for parents to support and guide their children, but not to make decisions for them that will impact their entire future.",
        "I appreciate the positive side's perspective, but I still firmly believe that parents should not decide which career their children will pursue. While parental guidance can be helpful, ultimately it is the child who will be living and working in their chosen career for the rest of their lives.

What may have been a good career choice for the parents may not necessarily be the best choice for their child's future. It is important for children to have the opportunity to explore and discover new career paths that may not have been available or considered by their parents.\n\nAdditionally, while parental involvement may not always lead to resentment or strained relationships, it can create a power dynamic where the child feels pressured to follow their parents' wishes rather than their own desires. This can lead to a lack of motivation and investment in their work, as they may feel like they are not pursuing their own passions and interests.\n\nIn summary, while parental guidance can be helpful, it is ultimately important for children to have the freedom to explore their own interests and passions and make their own decisions about their future career paths.",
