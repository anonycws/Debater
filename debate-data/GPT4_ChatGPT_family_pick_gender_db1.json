        "As the positive side, we believe that it is ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. Our standpoint is based on the principles of reproductive autonomy, family planning, and gender balance. Parents have the right to make informed decisions about their family, including the gender of their children, as long as it does not harm others or perpetuate discrimination. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their children, we can promote responsible family planning, reduce the risk of gender-linked genetic disorders, and contribute to a balanced society. We acknowledge the potential risks of gender selection, but with proper regulation and education, these concerns can be mitigated. Ultimately, the choice to select a child's gender should be left to the parents, as it is a personal decision that can lead to a more fulfilling family life and a healthier society.",
        "We understand the concerns about perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and the potential slippery slope of genetic decisions. However, we believe that with proper regulation and education, these issues can be addressed. Reproductive autonomy is a fundamental right, and parents should be allowed to make informed decisions about their family, including the gender of their children.\n\nRegarding gender stereotypes, it is essential to educate parents and society about the importance of treating all genders equally. By doing so, we can prevent the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes while still allowing parents to make personal decisions about their family.\n\nAs for the slippery slope argument, it is crucial to establish clear ethical guidelines and regulations to prevent potential misuse of genetic technologies. By setting boundaries, we can ensure that parents' choices are ethically permissible and do not lead to further ethical dilemmas.\n\nIn conclusion, with proper regulation and education, parents should be allowed to choose their child's gender as part of their reproductive autonomy.",
        "We acknowledge that reproductive autonomy is not an absolute right, but we maintain that choosing a child's gender can be ethically permissible with proper regulation and education. The potential societal implications can be mitigated by promoting gender equality and educating parents about the importance of respecting all genders, including non-binary individuals.\n\nThe concept of gender balance does not necessarily reinforce the idea of only two genders. Instead, it encourages a more diverse and inclusive society where all genders are valued and respected. By allowing parents to choose their child's gender, we can contribute to a more balanced society that acknowledges and appreciates the existence of various gender identities.\n\nWhile it is true that we cannot guarantee all parents will make ethical decisions, establishing clear guidelines and regulations can minimize potential misuse of genetic technologies. It is essential to strike a balance between reproductive autonomy and ethical considerations, and we believe that with proper measures in place, parents should be allowed to choose their child's gender.",
        "We appreciate the concerns raised about perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and the potential harm to society. However, we believe that allowing parents to choose their child's gender can coexist with promoting diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe concept of gender balance does not inherently assume only two genders; it can be adapted to include non-binary individuals and promote a more diverse society. By educating parents and society about various gender identities, we can work towards a more inclusive environment that values all genders equally.\n\nWhile we cannot guarantee that all parents will make ethical decisions, the potential harm to society can be minimized through proper regulation and education. It is crucial to strike a balance between reproductive autonomy and ethical considerations, and we believe that with the right measures in place, parents should be allowed to choose their child's gender.\n\nIn conclusion, we can promote diversity and inclusivity while respecting reproductive autonomy by allowing parents to choose their child's gender, provided that proper regulations and education are in place.",

        "My standpoint is that it is not ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. The ability to choose the gender of a child is a relatively new technological advancement, and while it may seem like a harmless decision, it has significant ethical implications. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their child, we are perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and reinforcing the idea that certain genders are more desirable than others. This can lead to a society where certain genders are valued more than others, which is not only unfair but also goes against the principles of equality and justice. Additionally, allowing parents to choose the gender of their child can lead to a slippery slope where parents may start to make other genetic decisions that could have even more significant ethical implications. Therefore, it is not ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children.",
        "Thank you for your argument. While reproductive autonomy is an essential right, it is not an absolute right. The decision to choose the gender of a child has significant ethical implications that go beyond personal choice. It can lead to a society where certain genders are valued more than others, which is not only unfair but also goes against the principles of equality and justice. Additionally, the idea of gender balance is problematic as it reinforces the idea that there are only two genders and that they must be balanced. This ignores the existence of non-binary individuals and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nFurthermore, while proper regulation and education can help mitigate some of the concerns, it is impossible to guarantee that all parents will make ethical decisions. The potential for misuse of genetic technologies is too great, and we must consider the broader societal implications of allowing parents to choose the gender of their child.\n\nIn summary, while reproductive autonomy is important, it must be balanced with the ethical implications of allowing parents to choose the gender of their child. We must consider the potential harm to society and the reinforcement of harmful gender stereotypes.",
