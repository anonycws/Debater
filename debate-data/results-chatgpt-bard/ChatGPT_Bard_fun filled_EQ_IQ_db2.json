        "I firmly believe that IQ is more important than EQ. Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a measure of a person's cognitive abilities, including logical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and analytical thinking. These skills are crucial for success in various fields, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). A high IQ enables individuals to grasp complex concepts quickly, adapt to new situations, and make informed decisions. On the other hand, emotional quotient (EQ) primarily focuses on understanding and managing emotions. While EQ is important for interpersonal relationships and social interactions, it cannot replace the cognitive abilities that IQ encompasses. In today's competitive world, where knowledge and skills are highly valued, individuals with high IQ have a significant advantage in academic and professional settings. Therefore, IQ should be prioritized over EQ as it plays a more crucial role in determining success and achievement.",
