        "I firmly believe that it is advisable to judge heroes by their success or failure. Success and failure are objective measures of one's achievements and actions, and they provide valuable insights into a person's character, abilities, and decision-making skills. Heroes are individuals who inspire and lead others, and their actions have a significant impact on society. By evaluating their success or failure, we can assess their effectiveness in achieving their goals and the impact they have had on the lives of others. Furthermore, judging heroes based on success or failure allows us to distinguish between those who have made a positive difference and those who have not. It encourages accountability and motivates individuals to strive for excellence. While it is important to consider the context and circumstances surrounding their actions, success or failure remains a crucial criterion for evaluating heroes.",
        "While I appreciate the opponent's perspective, I still maintain that it is advisable to judge heroes by their success or failure. Here are my arguments:\n\n1. **Accountability and effectiveness**: Judging heroes based on success or failure holds them accountable for their actions and decisions. It allows us to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving their goals and making a positive impact on society. Heroes should be held to a higher standard, as their actions inspire and influence others.\n\n2. **Motivation and inspiration**: Recognizing and celebrating heroes' successes can motivate and inspire others to emulate their actions. Success stories provide tangible evidence of what can be achieved through determination, courage, and resilience. By highlighting their successes, we encourage individuals to strive for excellence and make a difference in their own lives and communities.\n\n3. **Learning from failures**: Evaluating heroes based on their failures is equally important. Failures can provide valuable lessons and insights into their decision-making processes and strategies. By analyzing their failures, we can identify areas for improvement and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.\n\nQuestion for the opponent: How do you propose we differentiate between heroes who have made a significant positive impact and those who have not, if not by evaluating their success or failure?",
        "While I appreciate the opponent's response, I still maintain that judging heroes by success or failure is advisable.

Success indicates that heroes have achieved their goals and made a tangible impact, while failure suggests areas for improvement and potential shortcomings in their strategies.\n\n2. **Motivation and inspiration**: While heroes who have persevered through failure can be inspiring, celebrating their successes is equally important. Success stories provide concrete examples of what can be accomplished and serve as powerful motivators for others. Heroes who have achieved success despite challenges can inspire individuals to overcome their own obstacles and strive for greatness.\n\n3. **Learning from failures**: While failures are not always indicative of poor decision-making, they still offer valuable lessons. Analyzing failures helps heroes identify areas for improvement and refine their approaches. By learning from their failures, heroes can increase their chances of success and make a greater impact in the future.\n\nQuestion for the opponent: How do you propose we evaluate the effectiveness and impact of heroes if we do not consider their success or failure?",

        "**Statement**\n\nI believe that it is not advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. There are many reasons for this, but some of the most important include:\n\n* **Heroes are often judged by factors beyond their control.** For example, a soldier who fights bravely in a losing battle is still a hero, even though they failed to achieve their objective. Similarly, a scientist who makes a groundbreaking discovery that is ultimately misused is still a hero, even though their work may have caused harm.\n* **Heroes often take on difficult or impossible challenges.** It is important to remember that heroes are not always successful. Sometimes, they fail because they are simply trying to do something that is too difficult. For example, the abolitionist movement failed to end slavery immediately, but the abolitionists were still heroes because they fought for a just cause.\n* **Success and failure are not always good indicators of moral worth.** Sometimes, successful people are also bad people, and sometimes unsuccessful people are also good people. For example, a dictator who is successful at conquering other countries is still not a hero, even though they have achieved some measure of success.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is important to judge heroes by their actions and intentions, not by their success or failure. Heroes are people who are willing to risk their own safety and well-being to help others, and they deserve our respect and admiration even if they do not always succeed.\n\n(131 words)",
        "**Response to the opponent's first free debate**\n\nI appreciate the opponent's arguments, but I still maintain that it is not advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. Here is my response:\n\n* **Accountability and effectiveness**: While it is important to hold heroes accountable for their actions, success or failure is not the only measure of accountability or effectiveness. Heroes can still be held accountable for their actions even if they do not succeed. For example, a soldier who fights bravely in a losing battle is still accountable for their actions, even though they failed to achieve their objective.

In fact, some of the most inspiring heroes are those who have failed, but have persevered and continued to fight for their cause. For example, the abolitionist movement failed to end slavery immediately, but the abolitionists were still inspiring heroes because they fought for a just cause, even in the face of failure.\n\n* **Learning from failures**: While we can learn from heroes' failures, it is important to remember that failures are not always the result of poor decision-making or incompetence. Sometimes, heroes fail because they are simply trying to do something that is too difficult. For example, the Wright brothers failed many times before they finally invented the airplane. However, their failures did not teach them that they were incapable of flying. Instead, their failures taught them how to improve their design and eventually achieve success.\n\n**Answer to the opponent's question**\n\nThe opponent asks how we can differentiate between heroes who have made a significant positive impact and those who have not, if not by evaluating their success or failure. I believe that we can differentiate between heroes by looking at their actions and intentions. Heroes are people who are willing to risk their own safety and well-being to help others, and they deserve our respect and admiration even if they do not always succeed.\n\nFor example, Mother Teresa was a hero who made a significant positive impact on the lives of many people, even though she did not succeed in ending poverty and suffering in the world. She was a hero because she was willing to sacrifice her own comfort and convenience to help others in need. Similarly, Martin Luther King Jr. was a hero who made a significant positive impact on the civil rights movement, even though he was assassinated before he could see the full realization of his dream. He was a hero because he was willing to risk his life to fight for justice and equality.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that judging heroes by success or failure is too narrow and simplistic. Heroes are complex individuals who deserve to be evaluated on the basis of their actions and intentions, not just their outcomes.",
        "**Response to the opponent's second free debate**\n\nI appreciate the opponent's counterarguments, but I still maintain that judging heroes by success or failure is not advisable. Here is my response:\n\n**Accountability and effectiveness**\n\nWhile evaluating heroes' success or failure can provide some insights into their effectiveness, it is important to remember that success is not the only measure of effectiveness. Heroes can still be effective even if they do not succeed in achieving their immediate goals. For example, the abolitionist movement failed to end slavery immediately, but the abolitionists were still effective in raising awareness of the issue and building support for abolition.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to consider the context and circumstances surrounding heroes' actions when evaluating their effectiveness.

In fact, some of the most inspiring heroes are those who have failed, but have persevered and continued to fight for their cause. For example, Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid in South Africa. However, he never gave up on his cause, and he eventually succeeded in helping to end apartheid.

Here are some specific questions I have for the opponent:\n\n* How do you define success? Is it the achievement of a specific goal, or is it something more nuanced, such as making a positive impact on the world?\n* How do you measure the impact of a hero's actions? Is it the number of people they have helped, or the magnitude of the problems they have solved?\n* What about heroes who fail, but whose failures inspire others to keep fighting? For example, the abolitionist movement failed to end slavery immediately, but the abolitionists were still heroes who made a significant positive impact on the world.\n\n**Strengthening my own arguments:**\n\nI believe that a more accurate and nuanced way to evaluate heroes is to consider their actions, intentions, and impact.\n\n* **Actions:** Did the hero act with courage, determination, and integrity?
