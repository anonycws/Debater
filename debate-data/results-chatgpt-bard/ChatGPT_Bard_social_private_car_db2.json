        "**Statement:**\n\nI am against limiting the number of private cars. I believe that everyone should have the freedom to choose the mode of transportation that best suits their needs.\n\nThere are many reasons why people choose to own private cars. For some people, it is the most convenient way to get around. They may have to travel long distances to work or school, or they may have young children or elderly parents who need help getting around. For others, owning a car is a status symbol or a source of personal freedom.\n\nLimiting the number of private cars would have a number of negative consequences. It would make it more difficult for people to get around, especially those who live in rural areas or who have disabilities. It would also lead to increased congestion on public transportation and make it more difficult for people to get to work and school on time.\n\nIn addition, limiting the number of private cars would have a negative impact on the economy. The automobile industry is a major employer and contributes billions of dollars to the economy each year. Limiting the number of cars would lead to job losses and a decline in economic activity.\n\nI believe that we can address the concerns about traffic congestion and air pollution without limiting the number of private cars. We can invest in public transportation, build more roads, and encourage people to carpool and drive electric vehicles.\n\n**Question for the positive side:**\n\nWhat are the specific benefits of limiting the number of private cars?
