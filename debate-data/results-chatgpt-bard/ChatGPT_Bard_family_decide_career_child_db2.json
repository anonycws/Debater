        "**Statement**\n\nI believe that parents should not decide which career their children will pursue.

They may also have their own personal biases about certain careers.\n* **Pressuring children to pursue a certain career can lead to stress and resentment.** If children are not interested in the career that their parents have chosen for them, they are more likely to experience stress and anxiety.

Children know themselves best and are more likely to be successful in a career that they have chosen for themselves.
