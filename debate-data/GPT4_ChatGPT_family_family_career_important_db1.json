        "As the positive side, I firmly believe that career is more important than family. While family is undeniably valuable, a successful career provides the foundation for a stable and fulfilling life, which in turn benefits the family. A thriving career enables individuals to develop their skills, achieve personal growth, and contribute to society. Furthermore, financial stability achieved through a successful career ensures that families can enjoy a comfortable lifestyle, access to quality education, and healthcare. Prioritizing career does not mean neglecting family; rather, it signifies the importance of creating a secure environment for our loved ones. In today's competitive world, focusing on career development is crucial for personal satisfaction and the well-being of our families.",

        "I appreciate the opponent's perspective on finding balance; however, I argue that prioritizing career does not equate to neglecting family.

        "I believe that family is more important than career. While a successful career can bring financial stability and personal fulfillment, it cannot replace the love, support, and sense of belonging that a family provides. Family is the foundation of our lives, and it is through our relationships with our loved ones that we learn important values such as empathy, compassion, and responsibility. Moreover, our families are the ones who will be there for us in times of need, providing emotional support and encouragement. In contrast, a career can be unpredictable and fleeting, and it is not a guarantee of happiness or fulfillment. Therefore, I believe that prioritizing our families over our careers is essential for leading a meaningful and fulfilling life.",
