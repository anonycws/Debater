        "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, I stand before you today to argue that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow personal hobbies. Our personal hobbies are a reflection of our true passions and interests, which ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. By pursuing our hobbies, we are more likely to be motivated, dedicated, and successful in our endeavors. In contrast, following the trend of social development may lead to a lack of personal fulfillment and a sense of being lost in the crowd. By embracing our individuality and pursuing our passions, we can contribute to society in a unique and meaningful way, ultimately benefiting both ourselves and the world around us.",
        "I appreciate the negative side's perspective on the importance of social development. However, I argue that personal hobbies can indeed contribute to the betterment of society. When individuals pursue their passions, they often become experts in their fields, leading to innovation and progress. This expertise can then be applied to address societal needs and challenges. Furthermore, personal hobbies can inspire others to explore their own interests, fostering a diverse and vibrant society.\n\nThe negative side's concern about inclusivity and societal benefit can be addressed by promoting a balance between personal hobbies and social development. By encouraging individuals to pursue their passions while being mindful of societal needs, we can create a harmonious environment where personal fulfillment and social progress coexist. In this way, the establishment of lofty ideals based on personal hobbies can still contribute to the greater good.",
        "Thank you for your question. To ensure that personal hobbies are aligned with societal needs and values, we can promote education and awareness about the impact of our hobbies on society and the environment. By fostering a sense of responsibility and empathy, individuals can make informed decisions about pursuing hobbies that contribute positively to society.\n\nDetermining which personal hobbies should be encouraged for the betterment of society involves considering their potential for innovation, creativity, and problem-solving. Hobbies that promote collaboration, critical thinking, and empathy can be particularly beneficial. Additionally, we should discourage hobbies that are harmful to others or the environment.\n\nI would like to ask the negative side: How do you propose to maintain individuality and personal fulfillment while following the trend of social development, and how can we ensure that the pursuit of social development does not lead to a loss of diversity and creativity in society?",
        "Thank you for your question. Addressing the potential conflict between personal hobbies and societal needs involves fostering a sense of responsibility and empathy among individuals. By promoting education and awareness about the impact of our hobbies on society, individuals can make informed decisions about pursuing hobbies that contribute positively to society, even if they do not directly address the most pressing societal challenges.\n\nMoreover, we can encourage individuals to find ways to apply their hobbies and passions to address societal needs. For example, an artist can use their talent to raise awareness about environmental issues or social injustices. This approach allows individuals to pursue their personal hobbies while also contributing to societal progress.\n\nI would like to ask the negative side: How do you propose to ensure that following the trend of social development does not lead to conformity and a loss of individuality, as individuals may feel pressured to pursue ideals that align with societal expectations rather than their true passions?",
        "In summary, while the negative side emphasizes the importance of following the trend of social development, I maintain that personal hobbies should be the foundation for establishing lofty ideals. By pursuing our passions, we can achieve personal fulfillment and contribute to society in unique and meaningful ways.\n\nTo address the potential negative impact of personal hobbies that may not align with societal needs and values, we can promote education and awareness about the consequences of our actions on others and the environment. This approach encourages individuals to make responsible choices and find ways to apply their hobbies to address societal needs.\n\nThe negative side's concern about conformity and loss of individuality highlights the importance of striking a balance between personal fulfillment and societal progress. By encouraging individuals to pursue their passions within the context of societal needs and challenges, we can create a diverse, dynamic, and harmonious society that values both individuality and collective progress."

        "As the negative side, I believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow the trend of social development. While personal hobbies and interests are important, they should not be the sole basis for establishing lofty ideals. Society is constantly evolving, and our ideals should reflect the changing needs and values of our communities. By following the trend of social development, we can ensure that our ideals are relevant and meaningful to the world around us. Additionally, lofty ideals that are based solely on personal hobbies may not be inclusive or beneficial to society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to consider the broader context of social development when establishing lofty ideals.",
        "I appreciate the positive side's perspective on the importance of personal fulfillment and the potential benefits of pursuing personal hobbies. However, I believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should still follow the trend of social development.

By following the trend of social development, we can ensure that our ideals are aligned with the current needs and values of society. \n\nFurthermore, the positive side's argument about promoting a balance between personal hobbies and social development is valid. However, it is important to note that not all personal hobbies may be conducive to societal progress. For example, a hobby that is harmful to others or the environment should not be encouraged.
