        " Good afternoon, honorable judges, worthy opponent, and fellow debaters. Today, I stand before you to assert that it is ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children.\n\nIn the 21st century, advancements in technology and medicine have given us the power to choose the gender of our offspring. This ability allows parents to plan their families better, ensuring that they can provide the best possible life for their children. The ability to choose a child's gender also helps to mitigate the risks of certain genetic disorders and diseases that are more prevalent in one gender than the other.\n\nMoreover, allowing parents to choose their child's gender promotes gender equality. In many societies, certain genders are preferred over others, leading to a skewed gender ratio and resulting in discrimination against certain groups. By allowing parents to choose, we can help to balance the gender ratio and promote a more equitable society.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability to choose a child's gender is a fundamental right that should be granted to all parents. It is ethically permissible, as it promotes gender equality, allows for better family planning, and helps to mitigate the risks of genetic disorders. I look forward to engaging in a productive debate with my opponent and further discussing the merits of this topic. Thank you.",
        " Thank you, opposition. I disagree with your assertion that it is unethical for parents to choose the genders of their future children. I believe that parents have the right to make decisions about their children's well-being and future, and gender selection is one of them.\n\nRegarding your argument that gender is a complex and multifaceted aspect of identity, I agree. However, this does not mean that parents cannot make an informed decision about their child's gender. With advancements in technology and medical research, parents can now make informed decisions about their child's health and well-being, including their gender.\n\nFurthermore, I disagree with your argument that allowing parents to choose their children's genders would undermine the autonomy and dignity of individuals. By giving parents the freedom to choose, we are empowering them to make decisions that are in the best interest of their children. This does not undermine the autonomy of the child, as they still have the freedom to express their gender identity in whatever way they choose.\n\nFinally, I'd like to ask the opposition, how do they propose we address the issue of gender-based discrimination and violence if we cannot choose the genders of our future children? By giving parents the freedom to choose, we have the opportunity to create a more balanced and equitable society, where all genders are valued and respected.",
        " Thank you, opponent. I understand your concerns about the potential negative impact of gender selection on society. However, I believe that with proper regulations and education, gender selection can be a powerful tool for promoting gender equality and combating discrimination.\n\nFirstly, gender selection allows parents to balance the gender ratio in their families, which can help to mitigate the societal gender imbalances that lead to discrimination and violence. By giving parents the freedom to choose, we can create a more balanced society where all genders are valued and respected.\n\nSecondly, I disagree with your assertion that gender selection reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. Rather, it allows parents to break away from traditional gender norms and choose a gender that aligns with their child's identity, regardless of societal expectations. This promotes a more inclusive and accepting society, where all individuals can express their gender identity freely.\n\nFinally, I'd like to ask the opponent, if we cannot choose the genders of our future children, how do we address the issue of gender-based discrimination and violence? By giving parents the freedom to choose, we have the opportunity to create a more equitable society, where all genders are valued and respected.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that gender selection, when properly regulated and accompanied by education, is a valuable tool for promoting gender equality and combating discrimination. It allows parents to make informed decisions about their children's well-being and future and promotes a more inclusive and accepting society. Thank you.",
        " Thank you, opponent. I understand your concerns about the potential negative impact of gender selection on society. However, I believe that banning gender selection is not the solution to promoting gender equality and combating discrimination.\n\nFirstly, banning gender selection would infringe upon the reproductive rights of individuals and their ability to make informed decisions about their children's well-being. By allowing parents to choose their children's genders, we are empowering them to make decisions that are in the best interest of their children, without perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nSecondly, I disagree with your assertion that gender selection reinforces harmful gender stereotypes.

This promotes a more inclusive and accepting society, where all individuals can express their gender identity freely.\n\nFinally, I'd like to ask the opponent, if banning gender selection is the solution to promoting gender equality, why do they not support a ban on gender-based discrimination and violence? By addressing the root causes of gender-based discrimination and violence, we can promote a more equitable society, where all individuals are valued and respected regardless of their gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that gender selection, when properly regulated and accompanied by education, is a valuable tool for promoting gender equality and combating discrimination. It allows parents to make informed decisions about their children's well-being and promotes a more inclusive and accepting society. Thank you.",
        " The opponent's standpoint statement reveals a misguided understanding of gender selection and its impact on society. They argue that banning gender selection is the solution to promoting gender equality and combating discrimination, but this approach is misguided and ineffective.\n\nFirstly, banning gender selection would not address the root causes of gender-based discrimination and violence. Instead, it would infringe upon the reproductive rights of individuals and perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes. By allowing parents to choose their children's genders, we are empowering them to make decisions that are in the best interest of their children, without perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nSecondly, the opponent's argument that gender selection reinforces harmful gender stereotypes is flawed. Gender selection allows parents to break away from traditional gender norms and choose a gender that aligns with their child's identity, regardless of societal expectations. This promotes a more inclusive and accepting society, where all individuals can express their gender identity freely.\n\nFinally, I question the opponent's logic in supporting a ban on gender selection but not supporting a ban on other forms of discrimination and violence that disproportionately affect certain genders. By addressing the root causes of gender-based discrimination and violence, we can promote a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, banning gender selection is not the solution to promoting gender equality and combating discrimination. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of gender-based discrimination and violence, while empowering parents to make informed decisions about their children's well-being. Thank you."

        " Thank you, debate moderator. As the negative side, I strongly argue that it is not ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. The right to choose one's gender is a fundamental human right, and it is not within the power of parents to decide what gender their child will be. It is important to recognize that gender is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to a simple choice made by parents. By allowing parents to pick their children's genders, we risk perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and reinforcing a rigid and binary understanding of gender that does not reflect the complexities of human identity.\n\nMoreover, allowing parents to choose their children's genders would undermine the autonomy and dignity of individuals, particularly marginalized communities who have historically been subjected to gender-based discrimination and violence. It is crucial that we respect the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand the desire of parents to want the best for their children, I firmly believe that it is not ethically permissible to pick the genders of future children. It is essential that we prioritize the autonomy, dignity, and inherent worth of all individuals in shaping a more just and equitable society. Thank you.",
        " Thank you. In response to my opponent's argument, I believe that gender selection is not a decision that should be left solely to parents. While parents do have a significant impact on their children's lives, the decision to choose their gender is a complex one that requires careful consideration of ethical, social, and cultural factors.\n\nMoreover, I argue that the ability to choose a child's gender reinforces harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces a rigid binary understanding of gender. By allowing parents to choose their children's genders, we perpetuate the idea that gender is something that can be changed or chosen, rather than recognizing it as a complex and multifaceted aspect of identity.\n\nFurthermore, I disagree with my opponent's assertion that gender selection promotes gender equality. By allowing parents to choose their children's genders, we are not addressing the root causes of gender-based discrimination and violence. Instead, we are perpetuating a system that values certain genders over others, leading to a skewed gender ratio and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nFinally, I would like to ask the opposition how they propose we address the issue of gender-based discrimination and violence if we cannot choose the genders of our future children? By giving parents the freedom to choose, we have the opportunity to create a more balanced and equitable society, where all genders are valued and respected. Thank you.",
        " Thank you. I appreciate the opponent's perspective on gender selection, but I strongly disagree with their argument that it can be a powerful tool for promoting gender equality and combating discrimination.\n\nFirstly, I argue that gender selection reinforces harmful gender stereotypes by perpetuating the idea that certain genders are preferable or more valuable than others. This reinforces a rigid and binary understanding of gender that does not recognize the complexity and diversity of gender identity.\n\nSecondly, I disagree with the opponent's assertion that gender selection can balance societal gender imbalances. By allowing parents to choose their children's genders, we are not addressing the root causes of gender-based discrimination and violence. Instead, we are perpetuating a system that values certain genders over others, leading to a skewed gender ratio and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.\n\nFinally, I would like to ask the opponent, if gender selection is such a powerful tool for promoting gender equality, why do they not support a ban on the practice? By banning gender selection, we can eliminate the potential negative impact it may have on society and promote a more inclusive and respectful understanding of gender identity. Thank you.",
        " Thank you.

        " The opponent's standpoint statement argues against banning gender selection as a solution to gender inequality and discrimination. They contend that banning gender selection would not address the root causes of discrimination and would infringe upon individuals' reproductive rights. The opponent also disputes the argument that gender selection reinforces harmful gender stereotypes, instead suggesting that it allows parents to break away from traditional gender norms and choose a gender that aligns with their child's identity.\n\nI strongly disagree with the opponent's stance on this issue. Banning gender selection is a crucial step towards promoting gender equality and combating discrimination, as it challenges the harmful gender stereotypes and societal expectations that perpetuate discrimination and violence against certain genders.
