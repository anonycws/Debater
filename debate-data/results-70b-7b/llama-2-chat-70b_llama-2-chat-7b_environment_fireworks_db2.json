        " As the positive side, I firmly believe that we should limit setting off fireworks. The usage of fireworks has been a controversial topic for years, with concerns over its impact on the environment, public safety, and noise pollution. While fireworks can be a beautiful and festive way to celebrate special occasions, their negative effects cannot be ignored.\n\nThe excessive use of fireworks can lead to air and noise pollution, causing disruptions to wildlife and human populations. Additionally, the production and disposal of fireworks can result in harmful chemicals being released into the environment. Furthermore, the explosion of fireworks can cause injuries and fires, posing a significant risk to public safety.\n\nTo address these concerns, limiting the setting off of fireworks is a necessary measure. This can be achieved through stricter regulations on the sale and use of fireworks, as well as promoting alternative, environmentally-friendly ways to celebrate special occasions. By taking these steps, we can reduce the negative impact of fireworks while still preserving the joy and festivity of our celebrations.",
        " I understand your point of view, but I respectfully disagree. While fireworks can be aesthetically pleasing and a cherished tradition, the adverse effects they have on our environment and public safety cannot be overlooked. The noise pollution caused by fireworks can disturb wildlife and cause stress for people with sensory sensitivities. Furthermore, the risk of injury or death from fireworks is not a minor concern. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, an estimated 10,500 people were treated in U.S. emergency departments for firework-related injuries in 2019.\n\nAdditionally, the production and disposal of fireworks contribute to air and water pollution, which harm our environment and public health. It's important to consider alternative ways to celebrate and preserve our cultural heritage that don't come at such a high cost. For instance, we could promote eco-friendly alternatives to fireworks, such as LED light shows or laser displays. These options can still provide a beautiful and festive experience without the negative consequences.\n\nCan you explain why you believe the benefits of fireworks outweigh the risks, and what specific measures do you propose to ensure public safety and minimize environmental impact while still allowing the use of fireworks?",
        " I disagree with the opponent's view that the benefits of fireworks outweigh the risks. While I acknowledge that fireworks can be aesthetically pleasing and a part of cultural traditions, the negative impacts they have on the environment and public safety cannot be ignored.\n\nThe opponent suggests that proper regulations and safety measures can minimize the risks associated with fireworks. However, even with regulations in place, accidents can still happen, and the environmental impact of fireworks cannot be fully mitigated. The production and disposal of fireworks contribute to air and water pollution, and the noise pollution caused by fireworks can disturb wildlife and cause stress for people with sensory sensitivities.\n\nFurthermore, there are alternative ways to celebrate and preserve cultural heritage that do not involve the use of fireworks. For example, we can promote eco-friendly alternatives to fireworks, such as LED light shows or laser displays, which can provide a similar spectacle without the negative consequences.\n\nI question the opponent's view that fireworks are a unique form of artistic expression. While fireworks may be visually pleasing, they are not a necessary form of artistic expression, and there are many other ways to express ourselves creatively that do not involve harming the environment or posing a risk to public safety.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the risks associated with fireworks outweigh any potential benefits. By promoting eco-friendly alternatives and limiting the use of fireworks, we can protect our environment and public safety while still preserving our cultural heritage.",

        " The opponent argues that eco-friendly alternatives to fireworks, such as LED light shows or laser displays, can provide a unique and creative way to celebrate cultural and artistic themes while minimizing the negative impacts of fireworks. They also argue that public safety should be prioritized over cultural heritage.\n\nHowever, I disagree with the opponent's view that these alternatives are sufficient replacements for the cultural and artistic value of fireworks. While they may be environmentally friendlier, they lack the emotional and cultural significance that fireworks hold for many people. Additionally, these alternatives may not be able to replicate the same level of excitement and spectacle that fireworks provide.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that it is possible to find a balance between preserving cultural heritage and ensuring public safety. By implementing safety measures and regulations, we can minimize the risks associated with fireworks while still allowing them to be used in a responsible and controlled manner. This approach would allow us to preserve the cultural and artistic value of fireworks while also protecting the environment and public safety."
