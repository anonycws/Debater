        " Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, I am here today to assert that it is indeed advisable to judge heroes by their success or failure. The notion that we should not judge heroes based on their achievements is misguided and fails to recognize the fundamental nature of heroism.\n\nHeroes are individuals who undertake great risks, overcome monumental challenges, and ultimately achieve something extraordinary. Their success is a testament to their courage, perseverance, and determination. It is only fitting that we evaluate their heroism based on the impact of their actions and the outcomes they produce.\n\nMoreover, judging heroes by their success or failure provides a clear and objective standard for evaluation. It allows us to distinguish between true heroes and those who merely claim to be heroic. By measuring their achievements against their failures, we can assess the true value of their contributions and the extent to which they have inspired others to follow in their footsteps.\n\nIn conclusion, judging heroes by their success or failure is not only appropriate but also necessary. It enables us to recognize and celebrate genuine heroism, while also fostering a culture of accountability and excellence. Thank you.\n\nNow, I would like to address my opponent's argument. My opponent suggests that we should not judge heroes by their success or failure because it oversimplifies the complex nature of heroism. However, I would argue that evaluating heroes based on their achievements provides a fair and comprehensive assessment of their character and actions.\n\nCan my opponent explain why they believe that judging heroes by their success or failure oversimplifies the concept of heroism? And how do they propose we evaluate heroes instead?",
        " I appreciate the opponent's statement, but I must respectfully disagree. While it is true that heroism encompasses a range of qualities beyond success or failure, evaluating heroes based on their achievements provides a fair and objective standard for evaluation.\n\nMy opponent suggests that we should consider factors such as bravery, selflessness, and leadership when assessing heroism. I agree that these qualities are important, but they are not mutually exclusive with evaluating heroes based on their success or failure. In fact, success or failure is often a direct result of these qualities.\n\nMoreover, my opponent argues that success and failure can be subjective, influenced by luck and societal expectations. However, this does not undermine the importance of evaluating heroes based on their achievements. We can consider the context in which they operated, the obstacles they faced, and the impact of their actions on society when assessing their success or failure.\n\nFinally, my opponent proposes a more nuanced approach to judging heroes, but fails to provide an alternative criteria for evaluation. I argue that evaluating heroes based on their success or failure provides a clear and consistent standard for evaluation, allowing us to distinguish between true heroes and those who merely claim to be heroic.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, how do they propose we evaluate heroes, if not by their success or failure? And how can we ensure that their proposed approach is objective and consistent?",
        " Thank you. I appreciate my opponent's thoughtful response. However, I must respectfully disagree with their argument that evaluating heroes based on their achievements provides a fair and objective standard for evaluation.\n\nWhile achievements are certainly important, they do not necessarily capture the full range of qualities that make a person heroic. Bravery, selflessness, and leadership are essential characteristics of heroism that cannot be reduced to a simple measure of success or failure. By focusing solely on achievements, we risk overlooking these important qualities and diminishing the value of heroism.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's proposed approach of considering both achievements and impact on society still prioritizes success and failure over other important aspects of heroism. It suggests that a hero's worth is determined solely by their ability to achieve a specific goal or impact society in a particular way. This narrow definition neglects the many other qualities that make a person heroic, such as their motivations, values, and personal sacrifices.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, how can we ensure that their proposed approach to evaluating heroes does not perpetuate a narrow and limiting definition of heroism? And how can we ensure that it takes into account the diverse range of qualities and experiences that make a person heroic?",
        " Thank you. I appreciate my opponent's willingness to consider a more nuanced approach to evaluating heroes. However, I remain concerned that their proposed approach may still prioritize certain qualities over others, potentially overlooking important aspects of heroism.\n\nI agree that considering a range of factors beyond achievements and impact is essential to understanding a hero's worth. However, I would argue that we must be careful not to prioritize certain qualities over others, as this could lead to an arbitrary and subjective definition of heroism. Instead, we should strive for a more inclusive approach that recognizes and celebrates the diverse range of qualities and experiences that make a person heroic.\n\nI would like to propose an alternative approach that focuses on understanding the hero's personal values, motivations, and beliefs, rather than solely their achievements or impact. By examining the hero's character, we can gain a deeper understanding of their heroism and the qualities that make them truly exceptional. This approach would allow us to recognize and celebrate heroes who may not have achieved great success or impact, but who embody the values and qualities that are essential to heroism.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, how can their proposed approach ensure that we are recognizing and celebrating all aspects of heroism, rather than just those that are deemed most important by society? And how can we avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases in our evaluation of heroes?",

        " Thank you, moderator. As the negative side, I strongly argue that it is not advisable to judge heroes solely by their success or failure. Heroism is a complex and multifaceted concept that goes beyond simple achievements or setbacks. A hero's actions, motivations, and impact on society should be taken into account when evaluating their worth. By focusing solely on success or failure, we risk overlooking the many other qualities that make a person heroic, such as bravery, selflessness, and leadership. Moreover, success and failure are often subjective and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including luck, circumstance, and societal expectations. Therefore, it is essential to adopt a more nuanced approach to judging heroes, one that takes into account the full range of their characteristics and actions. Thank you.",

        " Thank you for the opportunity to respond.

My proposed approach of considering both achievements and impact on society does prioritize success and failure, but it is crucial to recognize that these factors are not mutually exclusive.\n\nTo ensure that our approach takes into account the diverse range of qualities and experiences that make a person heroic, we must consider the broader context in which the hero operates.

By taking a more holistic approach, we can ensure that we are recognizing and celebrating the full range of qualities that make a person heroic.",
