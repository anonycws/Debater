        "Ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to argue that Spanish bullfighting needs to stop. Bullfighting, also known as tauromachy, is a traditional spectacle in which a bull is subjected to a physical confrontation with a human, usually ending in the animal's death. This practice is not only cruel and inhumane but also unnecessary and outdated.\n\nFirstly, bullfighting is a violent and harmful activity that results in the suffering and death of innocent animals. Bulls are subjected to physical stress, pain, and fear during the fight, and are often killed in a slow and agonizing manner. This is unacceptable in modern society, where animal welfare is a growing concern.\n\nSecondly, bullfighting is not a necessary part of Spanish culture or tradition. While it may have had cultural significance in the past, it is no longer relevant in today's society. In fact, many Spanish citizens have spoken out against bullfighting, calling it a barbaric practice that has no place in modern Spain.\n\nLastly, bullfighting is not only cruel to animals but also poses a risk to human safety. Matadors and other participants are often injured during the fight, and spectators are at risk of being gored or trampled.\n\nIn conclusion, Spanish bullfighting needs to stop. It is a cruel and unnecessary practice that has no place in modern society. We must move towards a more compassionate and ethical future, where animals are treated with respect and dignity. Thank you.",
        "Thank you. As the positive side debater, I argue that Spanish bullfighting needs to stop. While I understand the cultural and historical significance of bullfighting, I believe that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that has no place in modern society.\n\nFirstly, the idea that bullfighting is a quick and humane way to kill a bull is a myth. The reality is that the bull is subjected to a slow and painful death, often taking several minutes to die. This is unacceptable in a society that values animal welfare.\n\nSecondly, the argument that bullfighting is a cultural tradition and a major tourist attraction does not justify its continuation. Many cultural traditions have been reevaluated and changed over time, and it is time for bullfighting to be reevaluated as well. Additionally, there are many alternative tourist attractions that do not involve animal cruelty.\n\nLastly, I question the opponent's argument that bullfighting connects people with their heritage and traditions. There are many ways to connect with our heritage and traditions that do not involve harming animals. In fact, many Spanish citizens have spoken out against bullfighting, calling it a barbaric practice that has no place in modern Spain.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand the historical significance of bullfighting, I believe that it is a cruel and inhumane practice that has no place in modern society. We must move towards a more compassionate and ethical future, where animals are treated with respect and dignity. Thank you.",
        "Thank you for your response. I understand that you believe that bullfighting should continue, but I would like to respectfully disagree.\n\nFirstly, while the bull is not killed for sport, the fact remains that it is still killed in a violent and inhumane manner. The bull is subjected to physical stress, pain, and fear during the fight, and its death is often slow and agonizing. This is unacceptable in modern society, where animal welfare is a growing concern.\n\nSecondly, while bullfighting may be a major tourist attraction and a source of revenue for the Spanish economy, this does not justify its continuation. Many cultural traditions have been reevaluated and changed over time, and it is time for bullfighting to be reevaluated as well. There are many alternative tourist attractions that do not involve animal cruelty.\n\nLastly, while injuries to matadors and other participants may be rare, it is still a risk that is unnecessary and unacceptable. Bullfighting is a dangerous and violent activity that has no place in modern society.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that bullfighting should be stopped. It is a cruel and inhumane practice that has no place in modern society. We must move towards a more compassionate and ethical future, where animals are treated with respect and dignity. Thank you.",

        "The opponent's standpoint statement argues that bullfighting should be allowed to continue because it is not killed for sport, but as part of a centuries-old ritual, and that it is killed quickly and humanely. They also argue that bullfighting is a major tourist attraction and a source of revenue for the Spanish economy, and that it allows people to connect with their heritage and traditions. Finally, they argue that injuries to matadors and other participants are relatively rare, making bullfighting a relatively safe sport.\n\nHowever, I would like to question the opponent's views on the matter. Firstly, the fact that bullfighting is a centuries-old ritual does not make it acceptable to continue killing animals for entertainment. Secondly, the argument that bullfighting is a major tourist attraction and a source of revenue does not justify the harm and suffering caused to the bulls. Lastly, the claim that bullfighting is a relatively safe sport is not convincing, as injuries and fatalities can still occur.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that bullfighting should be stopped because it is a cruel and inhumane practice that has no place in modern society. We must move towards a more compassionate and ethical future, where animals are treated with respect and dignity."
