        "Good afternoon, honorable judges, worthy opponent, and dear audience. Today, I stand before you to assert that it is ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children.\n\nIn recent years, advances in technology have enabled us to exercise greater control over our reproductive choices. With the advent of gender selection technology, parents can now choose the gender of their child with a high degree of accuracy. While some argue that this interferes with the natural order of things, I firmly believe that it is a parent's right to make informed decisions about their child's future.\n\nFirstly, allowing parents to choose their child's gender promotes gender equality. By giving them the opportunity to balance their family's gender ratio, parents can ensure that their children have equal opportunities in life, regardless of their gender. This is particularly important in societies where gender-based discrimination is still prevalent.\n\nSecondly, gender selection technology can help prevent certain genetic disorders that are specific to one gender. For example, by selecting a female embryo, parents can reduce the risk of their child developing X-linked diseases such as hemophilia. This not only benefits the child but also reduces the burden on the healthcare system.\n\nFinally, allowing parents to choose their child's gender respects their autonomy and reproductive rights. It is a fundamental human right to decide how and when to start a family, and this includes the gender of their children. By giving parents the freedom to make this choice, we are upholding their basic human rights.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. By doing so, we promote gender equality, prevent genetic disorders, and respect parents' autonomy and reproductive rights. Thank you.",
        "I disagree with my opponent's statement that it is not ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. I believe that parents have the right to make decisions about their children's well-being, including their gender. It is a parent's responsibility to ensure that their child has the best possible life, and this includes making choices that will benefit their child's health, happiness, and future success.\n\nFurthermore, I do not believe that allowing parents to choose their child's gender raises concerns about children's autonomy or bodily integrity. Parents make decisions about their children's health and well-being all the time, from vaccinations to education, and gender selection is simply another aspect of this.\n\nMy opponent's argument that children should have a say in what happens to their bodies is not applicable in this case, as children are not capable of making informed decisions about their own gender identity at such a young age. It is a parent's job to make decisions that are in the best interests of their child, and selecting their gender is one of those decisions.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, how do they propose we address the issue of gender imbalances in society, if not through gender selection technology? Would they advocate for a return to traditional gender roles and stereotypes, or do they have an alternative solution that does not involve empowering parents to make informed choices about their children's futures?",
        "I disagree with my opponent's argument that allowing parents to choose the sex of their children takes away their autonomy and could lead to social problems. Parents make decisions about their children's well-being all the time, and gender selection is simply another aspect of this. Children are not capable of making informed decisions about their own gender identity at such a young age, so it is up to parents to make this decision for them.\n\nRegarding the issue of gender imbalances in society, I believe that gender selection technology can play a role in addressing this issue. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their children, we can help to create a more balanced society where all genders have equal opportunities. This technology can also help to reduce the incidence of gender-based discrimination and violence, which are major contributors to gender imbalances.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, how do they propose we address the issue of gender imbalances in society, if not through gender selection technology? Do they believe that we should simply accept these imbalances and do nothing to address them? Or do they have an alternative solution that does not involve empowering parents to make informed choices about their children's futures?",
        "I understand my opponent's concerns about respecting children's autonomy and avoiding social problems. However, I believe that these concerns can be addressed through proper regulations and education.\n\nFirstly, children's autonomy can be respected by involving them in the decision-making process. For example, parents can discuss the options with their child and respect their wishes, while still maintaining the final decision-making authority. This approach can help children feel involved and empowered, while also ensuring that the decision is made with their best interests in mind.\n\nSecondly, social problems can be mitigated through education and awareness campaigns. By educating parents and society about the importance of gender equality and the potential consequences of gender selection, we can promote a culture of acceptance and respect for all genders. This can help reduce the likelihood of discrimination against certain genders and promote a more balanced society.\n\nFinally, while there are other ways to ensure children's happiness and health, gender selection technology can be a valuable tool in addressing gender imbalances. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their child, we can help create a more balanced society where all genders have equal opportunities. This technology can also help reduce the incidence of gender-based discrimination and violence, which are major contributors to gender imbalances.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, do they believe that gender imbalances in society are a significant issue that needs to be addressed? If so, how do they propose we address this issue, given that gender selection technology is not an option?",
        "The opponent's statement emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of gender imbalances, such as cultural norms and economic disparities, rather than relying on gender selection technology. They also raise concerns about the potential unintended consequences of gender selection technology, such as a decrease in the number of girls being born, and the importance of respecting children's autonomy.\n\nWhile I understand their concerns, I believe that gender selection technology can be a valuable tool in addressing gender imbalances, particularly in societies where gender-based discrimination is prevalent. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their children, we can help create a more balanced society where all genders have equal opportunities. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns can be effective in promoting gender equality and reducing discrimination against certain genders.\n\nI would like to ask my opponent, how do they propose we address the root causes of gender imbalances, such as cultural norms and economic disparities, without relying on gender selection technology? What alternative solutions do they suggest, and how effective do they believe these solutions will be in creating a more equitable society?"
