        "Good afternoon, honorable judges, and dear opponent. I am here to assert that parental support is indeed critical to a child's future success. As the positive side, I believe that children rely heavily on their parents for guidance, nurturing, and resources that are crucial to their development and success.\n\nParental support encompasses various aspects, including emotional support, financial support, and educational support. Emotional support helps children develop a sense of security and self-worth, which is vital for their mental health and well-being. Financial support enables children to access quality education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities that help shape their skills and interests. Educational support from parents, such as helping with homework and engaging in educational activities, significantly improves a child's academic performance.\n\nMoreover, parental support instills valuable life skills and values in children, including responsibility, hard work, and resilience. Parents serve as role models, and their positive behavior and attitudes have a profound impact on their children's development.\n\nIn conclusion, parental support plays a critical role in shaping a child's future success. Its absence can leave children vulnerable to various challenges, including academic underperformance, low self-esteem, and unhealthy behaviors. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the importance of parental support in ensuring a child's bright and successful future. Thank you.\n\nNow, I would like to ask my opponent, what is your opinion on the role of parental support in a child's future success? How do you justify your stance?",
        "I disagree with my opponent's statement that parental support is not always essential for a child's future success. While it is true that some children have achieved success despite lacking support from their parents, it is not accurate to say that parental support is not critical.\n\nFirstly, children need consistent and stable support from their parents to develop a sense of security and self-worth. Without this support, children may struggle with low self-esteem and confidence, which can hinder their ability to succeed in life.\n\nSecondly, parental support is crucial in shaping a child's values, beliefs, and behaviors. Parents are the primary role models for their children, and their influence can have a lasting impact on a child's development.\n\nThirdly, parental support can provide children with access to resources and opportunities that they may not have otherwise had. For example, parents can help their children with homework, provide them with educational resources, and encourage them to participate in extracurricular activities.\n\nI would ask my opponent, how do they explain the success of children who have had supportive parents? Is it not possible that the support and resources provided by their parents played a significant role in their success?\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that some children have achieved success without parental support, it is not accurate to say that parental support is not essential for a child's future success. Parental support provides children with the foundation they need to succeed in life.",

        "The opponent's statement suggests that parental support is not always necessary for a child's success, citing examples of successful individuals who grew up in less than ideal home environments.

        " The impact of parental support on a child's future success is a topic of great debate. While it is undeniable that parental support can be beneficial, it is not always essential for a child to achieve success. In fact, there are many cases of highly successful individuals who grew up in less than ideal\u5bb6\u5ead. \n\nThere are several reasons why parental support may not be critical to a child's future success. First, children are naturally resilient and resourceful. They are capable of overcoming adversity and finding ways to succeed, even if they do not have the full support of their parents. \n\nSecond, there are many other factors that can contribute to a child's success, such as their own natural abilities, the support of other adults in their lives, and the opportunities that they are given. In some cases, parental support can even be counterproductive, if it is too overbearing or controlling. \n\nOf course, parental support can be very helpful for a child's development. Supportive parents can provide their children with love, guidance, and encouragement, which can help them to reach their full potential. However, it is important to remember that parental support is not always necessary for a child to succeed. \n",

As previously mentioned, there are many examples of highly successful individuals who grew up in less than ideal\u5bb6\u5ead. These individuals were able to overcome their circumstances and achieve success despite the lack of support from their parents.\n\nI also believe that the role of parental support is often overstated. While parents can certainly provide their children with love, guidance, and encouragement, it is ultimately up to the child to take advantage of these opportunities and use them to their full potential. In fact, some children may even be hindered by their parents' support, if it is too overbearing or controlling.\n\nFinally, I believe that there are many other factors that can contribute to a child's success, such as their own natural abilities, the support of other adults in their lives, and the opportunities that they are given. In some cases, these factors may be more important than parental support in determining a child's future success.\n\nIn response to my opponent's question, I would say that the success of children who have had supportive parents is not necessarily due to their parents' support. These children may have also had other advantages, such as natural abilities, the support of other adults, or access to opportunities that helped them to succeed.\n",
