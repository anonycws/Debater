        "As the positive side, I firmly believe that the establishment of lofty ideals should follow personal hobbies. When individuals pursue their passions and interests, they are more likely to find meaning and purpose in their lives. By setting goals and working towards them, they can develop a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that is essential for personal growth and happiness. Moreover, personal hobbies often align with unique strengths and talents, allowing individuals to make meaningful contributions to society in their own distinct way.\n\nIn contrast, following the trend of social development may lead to a lack of authenticity and originality in one's pursuit of lofty ideals. When individuals conform to societal expectations, they may sacrifice their individuality and creativity, ultimately feeling unfulfilled and disconnected from their passions. By prioritizing personal hobbies, individuals can cultivate a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment that is genuine and sustainable.",
        "I disagree with the opponent's statement that lofty ideals should follow the trend of social development rather than personal hobbies. While it is true that lofty ideals are meant to be pursued by a large group of people, this does not mean that they must align with the values and goals of society as a whole. In fact, many lofty ideals are achieved by individuals who dare to challenge the status quo and pursue their own unique vision.\n\nMoreover, personal hobbies can often be a source of inspiration and creativity that can lead to innovative solutions to societal problems. By allowing individuals to pursue their passions, we can tap into their unique strengths and talents, leading to more diverse and effective solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the opponent's argument that lofty ideals based on personal hobbies are less likely to be widely embraced and supported is not necessarily true. Many successful movements and initiatives have started with a single individual's passion and vision, and have gone on to inspire countless others.\n\nFinally, the opponent's argument that lofty ideals based on the trend of social development are more achievable is also questionable. While it may be easier to achieve consensus and support for ideas that align with societal norms, this does not necessarily mean that they are the most effective or impactful solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that personal hobbies can be a valuable source of inspiration for lofty ideals, and that individuals should be encouraged to pursue their passions, even if they go against the trend of social development. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of human creativity and innovation, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions to societal problems.",
