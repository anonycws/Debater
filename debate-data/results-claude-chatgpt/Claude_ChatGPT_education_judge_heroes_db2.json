        " Here is my statement as the positive side supporting \"It is advisable to judge heroes by success or failure\":\n\nWhile not the only factor, success or failure is an important standard by which to measure heroic acts and accomplishments. Heroes take courageous risks and make sacrifices to achieve ambitious goals that serve the greater good. Whether they attain these goals is highly relevant to appraising their heroism. While a failed effort does not negate bravery or intent, success demonstrates that courage and sacrifice were not in vain but changed outcomes for the better. To disregard results is to dismiss the impact a heroic act had. We must judge deeds by their consequences to properly calibrate their significance and influence. Outcomes are not the sole metric, but they provide vital context for understanding the heroic nature of what was risked and endured.",
        " I appreciate your perspective. While intentions and efforts are important, the impact of noble acts is what inspires others and shapes our world. Would disregarding results not diminish that impact? True, outcomes involve factors beyond one's control, but they provide a meaningful gauge of influence. If I strive to end world hunger but see no progress despite exhaustive efforts, have I achieved anything significant as a \"hero\"? You're right that judging solely on success could discourage risk-taking, but acknowledging different types of contributions maintains motivation while still recognizing consequences. I don't advocate reducing heroes to \"winners and losers\" but outcomes help determine where efforts did or did not drive meaningful change. Intentions alone change nothing; results show the degree of positive influence. Both deserve consideration in a full evaluation.",
        " You raise thoughtful points. However, I don't think acknowledging outcomes necessitates judging heroes \"solely\" on that basis or reducing their contributions down in that way. No single factor can fully capture someone's heroism. Recognizing both intentions and impacts allows for a more holistic, nuanced understanding. Even if change is not immediate, assessing progress over time helps evaluate influence on the issues heroes cared deeply about. Dedication alone does not equal significance if nothing is achieved in the end. At the same time, outcomes should not erase remembered efforts of those who tried but fell short. A balanced perspective is needed. By considering both drive and effect, we can properly laud perseverance while still holding heroes accountable for driving real change. This approach maintains motivation without discouraging risk-taking. Both intention and impact hold value in fully recognizing heroism.",
        " You make a persuasive argument. I agree we must acknowledge that heroism and progress can take non-linear paths, and that challenges may delay tangible results. A balanced and nuanced approach is indeed needed to avoid overlooking long-term influence or incremental advances. Heroes should certainly be celebrated for their courage and convictions regardless of short-term outcomes. Perhaps the most comprehensive perspective considers both intentions and the ultimate realization of goals or vision, without diminishing efforts simply because change could not be immediate. Impacts take time to fully materialize, and heroes may plant seeds that blossom in later years. If we assess both commitment and consequences once a fair period has passed, that allows honoring perseverance while still discerning where visions did or did not shape our future. This holistic perspective recognizes the complexity of heroism without discouraging risk-taking or innovation.",
        " You have put forth an insightful perspective throughout this discussion. While I agree we must approach heroism with nuance to avoid oversimplification, I believe outcomes still deserve consideration alongside intentions as part of a holistic evaluation. Recognizing both commitment and consequences encourages continued progress towards goals while still celebrating those who strive to better the world against adversity. Acknowledging impacts over time need not reduce heroes down or solely define them by achievements against checklists - but nor should we entirely disregard results. A balanced assessment allows honoring both courageous efforts and actual influence driven. While celebrating values and what heroes represent, understanding real change created maintains accountability. My stance has been that a perspective acknowledging all factors, from intentions to long-term consequences, most fully recognizes both the complex nature and true significance of heroism."

        "I firmly believe that it is not advisable to judge heroes solely based on their success or failure. Heroes should be evaluated based on their character, values, and the impact they have on society, rather than just their achievements or mistakes. Success and failure are subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as luck, circumstances, and external support. Judging heroes solely on their success can lead to a narrow and superficial understanding of their contributions. It is important to consider the intentions, efforts, and sacrifices made by heroes, regardless of the outcome. Moreover, focusing on success or failure can discourage individuals from taking risks and pursuing noble causes, as they may fear being judged solely on the outcome. Heroes should be celebrated for their courage, resilience, and the values they embody, rather than being reduced to mere winners or losers.",
        "I appreciate your perspective as well. While it is true that the impact of noble acts is important, I believe that judging heroes solely based on success or failure oversimplifies the evaluation process. Disregarding results does not necessarily diminish the impact of heroic acts. It is essential to consider the intentions, efforts, and sacrifices made by heroes, as these factors contribute to the overall significance of their actions. \n\nIn your example of striving to end world hunger, even if there is no immediate progress, the efforts made can still be significant. The hero's dedication and commitment to such a noble cause should not be undermined by the lack of immediate success. Furthermore, judging heroes solely on outcomes can lead to a narrow understanding of their contributions. It is important to recognize that heroes can have a profound impact on individuals and society, even if their actions do not result in immediate and tangible change.\n\nBy focusing solely on success or failure, we risk discouraging individuals from taking risks and pursuing noble causes. Heroes should be celebrated for their courage, resilience, and the values they embody, rather than being reduced to mere winners or losers based on outcomes.",
        "Thank you for your response. I agree that a balanced perspective is needed when evaluating heroes, considering both intentions and impacts. However, my concern lies in the potential for outcomes to overshadow the efforts and sacrifices made by heroes. While it is true that dedication alone does not equal significance if nothing is achieved in the end, it is important to recognize that heroism is not solely defined by immediate and tangible change.\n\nHeroes often face complex challenges and systemic barriers that may hinder their ability to achieve immediate success. By solely focusing on outcomes, we risk overlooking the long-term impact and the ripple effects of their actions. It is crucial to acknowledge the incremental progress, the inspiration they provide, and the seeds of change they sow, even if the full realization of their goals may take time.\n\nFurthermore, by holding heroes accountable for driving real change, we may inadvertently discourage risk-taking and innovation. Heroes should be celebrated for their courage, resilience, and the values they embody, regardless of the immediate outcomes. Their contributions should be evaluated in a more nuanced manner that considers the broader context and the lasting impact they have on society.",
