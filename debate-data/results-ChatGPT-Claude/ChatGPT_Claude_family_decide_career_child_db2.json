        "As a senior debater, I strongly believe that parents should decide which career their children will pursue. Parents have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can guide their children towards a career that aligns with their interests, skills, and values. Moreover, parents have a vested interest in their children's success and well-being, and they are more likely to make decisions that will benefit their children in the long run. \n\nOn the other hand, children may not have a clear understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, or the job market and industry trends. They may also be influenced by peer pressure or societal expectations, which can lead them down a path that is not suited to their abilities or interests. Therefore, it is essential for parents to play an active role in their children's career development and help them make informed decisions that will set them up for success in the future.",
        "Thank you for your statement. While I understand your perspective, I believe that parents should have a say in their children's career choices. It is true that children have their own unique talents, interests, and passions, but parents can help guide them towards a career that aligns with those qualities. \n\nParents have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can help their children make informed decisions about their future. They can provide valuable insights into the job market and industry trends, as well as offer advice on how to develop the necessary skills and qualifications for a particular career. \n\nFurthermore, parents have a vested interest in their children's success and well-being, and they are more likely to make decisions that will benefit their children in the long run. While it is important to allow children the freedom to explore their interests and passions, it is equally important for parents to play an active role in their children's career development. \n\nDo you not think that parents have a responsibility to guide their children towards a career that will provide them with financial stability and job security?",
        "Thank you for your response. While I agree that children should have the autonomy to choose a career that aligns with their talents, interests, and passions, I believe that parents should still play an active role in their children's career development. \n\nParents can provide guidance and support that empowers their children to make informed choices for themselves. They can help their children explore their interests and passions, and provide them with the resources and opportunities to develop the necessary skills and qualifications for a particular career. \n\nMoreover, parents can help their children navigate the job market and industry trends, and provide them with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

        " Respected judges, teachers and fellow students, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this important topic today.\n\nParents deciding their children's careers for them is misguided and counterproductive. Children have their own unique talents, interests and passions that should guide their choice of career, not their parents' desires. Forcing children into careers they do not want will likely result in failure, frustration and even rebellion.  \n\nAllowing children freedom in choosing their own path empowers them to build their self-confidence, develop crucial life skills and pursue what truly fulfills them. Parents can provide guidance and advice, but imposing their will robs children of the chance to find their own calling and makes for an unhappy worker at best. The career one chooses significantly impacts one's quality of life and sense of purpose; children deserve the autonomy to determine this for themselves.",
        " I understand parents want what is best for their children and aim to set them up for success. However, forcing children into careers they do not want will likely only result in unhappiness and lack of fulfillment.   \n\nWhile parents can provide guidance, ultimately children need the autonomy to choose a career aligned with their talents, interests and passions. Otherwise, they risk becoming disengaged workers who do not find meaning in their jobs. Having financial stability is important, but feeling a sense of purpose in one's work is essential for well-being.\n\nParents cannot fully understand their children's internal motivations and aspirations, so they are not best suited to \"decide\" a suitable career. They can offer advice based on experience, market trends and their children's skills, but the final choice must lie with the child. Otherwise the child will not be intrinsically motivated to succeed in that career.\n\nSo no, I do not think parents have a responsibility to decide their children's careers. They have a responsibility to provide guidance and support that empowers their children to make informed choices for themselves, in line with each child's unique qualities, talents and goals. Forcing a specific career risks robbing the child of autonomy and self-discovery.",
        " I agree that parents can and should play an active role in their children's career development by providing advice, resources, and opportunities that empower their children to make informed choices themselves. Guidance, insight and opportunities are crucial forms of support.   \n\nHowever, I do not think parents should \"decide\" their children's careers for them, because ultimately children need autonomy to choose a career aligned with their internal motivations and unique qualities. Forcing children into careers they do not desire risks leaving them unfulfilled and disengaged at work.   \n\nWhile parents can provide valuable insights into trends and opportunities, they cannot fully understand their children's inner interests, motivations and aspirations. Nor can parents guarantee their children will succeed in the career they choose for them. Children are more likely to succeed and be satisfied when they choose to pursue something they are intrinsically motivated by.\n\nSo yes, parents can and should provide guidance that helps their children make informed decisions for themselves. But the final choice must lie with the child. Allowing children freedom of choice, while still setting appropriate boundaries, provides an optimal balance between guidance and autonomy that empowers children to shape their own futures.   \n\nForced decisions risk stifling children's self-discovery, confidence and intrinsic motivation. Instead parents should focus on cultivating those qualities within their children to set them up for success, regardless of the specific career they ultimately choose.",
