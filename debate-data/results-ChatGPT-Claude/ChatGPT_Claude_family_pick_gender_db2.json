        "I firmly believe that it is ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. The ability to choose the gender of a child is a personal decision that should be left to the parents. It is a matter of reproductive autonomy and the right to make choices about one's own body and family. Parents may have various reasons for wanting to choose the gender of their child, such as family balancing, cultural or religious beliefs, or medical reasons. Denying them this choice would be a violation of their reproductive rights. Moreover, advances in technology have made it possible to select the gender of a child without causing harm to the child or society. Therefore, I believe that parents should have the freedom to choose the gender of their future children without facing ethical objections.",
        "Thank you for your statement. While I understand your concerns about perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and discrimination, I believe that allowing parents to choose the gender of their future children does not necessarily reinforce these ideas. In fact, it can be argued that it gives parents the opportunity to challenge traditional gender roles and expectations by allowing them to raise their children in a way that is not limited by societal norms.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that denying parents the ability to choose the gender of their future children is a violation of their reproductive autonomy and personal freedom. It is not our place to dictate what choices parents should make regarding their own bodies and families.\n\nI would like to ask you, do you believe that parents should have the right to make choices about their own reproductive health and family planning? And if so, why do you believe that choosing the gender of a child should be an exception to this right?",

And if so, what would those circumstances be?"

        " Okay, here is my statement:\n\nWhile parents naturally long for sons or daughters for various emotional reasons, acting on those preferences through gender selection perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and discrimination. Choosing a child's gender reinforces the flawed idea that a specific gender is \"preferable\" or will possess certain desirable traits simply by birth. This unfairly narrows and limits future children based solely on arbitrary and immutable characteristics assigned at birth. Gender is a social construct that should not determine one's abilities or opportunities. Parents should love and nurture their children for who they authentically are, not who they envisioned them to be based on selective gender preferences.",
        " Here is my response to the opponent's first free debate:\n\nWhile I agree that parents should have autonomy over most reproductive choices, choosing a child's gender based on preference goes beyond personal choice when it actively promotes gender discrimination andreinforces harmful stereotypes in society. The right to choose does not automatically make that choice ethical. As guardians of future generations, parents have a responsibility to challenge - not perpetuate - outdated gender norms. \n\nTo answer your question,I do believe parents should have reproductive autonomy but within reasonable moral limits. Where that autonomy could cause foreseeable harm to a child or society,there may need to be ethical constraints. Choosing a baby's gender based on non-medical reasons risks reinforcing the idea that one gender is \"better\" or \"preferred\" simply due to archaic norms, thereby potentially damaging future children and distorting societal progress towards gender equality.",
        "  Here is my response:\n\nWhile parents should have autonomy over most decisions regarding their own bodies, their choices extend beyond themselves when it involves creating a new life. Choosing a child's gender based on preference objectifies future children as mere extensions of parental will, rather than recognizing them as independent beings deserving of equal moral worth.\n\nYou argue that gender selection allows parents to challenge gender norms, but in reality it perpetuates the problematic view that gender determines capabilities and roles. Parents may raise children to defy stereotypes, but the very act of selecting a gender reinforces the stereotypes they seek to avoid.  \n\nTo answer your question, reproductive autonomy must consider the interests of future children. While parents' choices usually align with their child's best interests, gender selection prioritizes parental preference over a child's full humanity and equal moral worth. An exception is therefore warranted to protect vulnerable future generations from the harms of discrimination and stereotyping based solely on assigned gender at birth.",
        " Here is my response:\n\nWhile parents should have autonomy over most reproductive decisions, gender selection exceeds personal choice by objectifying future children as mere means to parental ends. Parents can raise children to challenge norms, but the act of selecting gender itself perpetuates the stereotypes that gender determines role and worth.   \n\nIn response to your questions: Reproductive autonomy must be balanced against the child's interests. While parents should have broad freedoms, exceptions are necessary where choices risk harming vulnerable children. Gender selection poses precisely this risk by promoting gender discrimination and stereotyping in a way that other reproductive choices do not. There is no slippery slope - we are narrowly evaluating whether gender selection in particular crosses an ethical line by unjustly privileging parents' preferences over children's equal moral status.\n\nTo summarize: While parents usually act in their children's best interests, gender selection prioritizes parental desire for a particular gender over recognizing each child's full humanity and moral worth. An ethical boundary is therefore justified here - not as a general restriction on reproductive choice, but specifically to protect future generations from the prospects of discrimination and stereotyping based solely on assigned gender at birth.",
        " Here is my summary response:\n\nWhile I appreciate your concessions that the interests of future children must be considered and that ethical boundaries may sometimes be necessary to protect against discrimination, I overall stand by my position that gender selection is rarely, if ever, ethically permissible.  \n\nWhile you argue that gender selection could potentially challenge gender norms in some cases, the very act of selecting a gender based on preference reinforces the problematic view that gender determines roles and abilities. This risks harming future children by promoting gender stereotyping and discrimination.  \n\nYou ask if there are any ethical circumstances where gender selection could be allowed. I believe exceptions may be possible in limited scenarios that are designed specifically to avoid- not perpetuate- gender bias, such as for medical reasons or to redress gender imbalances in families with previously selected genders. However, in general, parents selecting gender based on non-medical preference risks compromising children's equal moral worth, which outweighs parents' reproductive autonomy in this narrow context.\n\nIn summary, while I acknowledge potential complexities, I overall maintain that gender selection based on parental preference is rarely, if ever, ethically justifiable given the potential risks of harming future generations through discrimination and stereotyping based solely on assigned gender at birth."
