        "Cloning ethically is acceptable. Cloning technology has the potential to bring about numerous benefits to society, including medical advancements, conservation of endangered species, and even the possibility of bringing back extinct species. Cloning can also help individuals who are struggling with infertility to have children. The ethical concerns surrounding cloning can be addressed through proper regulation and oversight. It is important to ensure that cloning is only used for beneficial purposes and not for unethical practices such as human cloning for reproductive purposes. The benefits of cloning technology outweigh the potential risks and ethical concerns, and therefore, it is ethically acceptable.",
        "Thank you for your statement. While I understand your concerns, I respectfully disagree with your viewpoint. Firstly, cloning does not damage human dignity as it does not diminish the uniqueness or value of an individual's life. Cloning can actually enhance human dignity by providing individuals with the opportunity to have children and families, which is a fundamental aspect of human life. Secondly, cloning does not conflict with the principle of procreation within marriage through a loving relationship, as cloning can be used as an alternative for individuals who are unable to conceive naturally. Thirdly, cloning does not threaten the family unit, as it is up to society to determine what constitutes a family. Cloning can provide individuals with the opportunity to have children and families, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status. It is important to regulate cloning technology to ensure that it is used for ethical purposes, but it is not inherently unethical. Do you have any questions for me?",
        "Thank you for your response. While I understand your concerns, I still believe that cloning can be ethically acceptable. Firstly, cloning does not treat humans as mere products to be manufactured. Cloning technology can be used to help individuals who are struggling with infertility to have children, which is a fundamental aspect of human life. The child's identity may be similar to the donor, but they are still unique individuals with their own experiences and personalities. Secondly, cloning does not bypass the intimate loving act between parents, as it can be used as an alternative for individuals who are unable to conceive naturally. Cloning can also provide individuals with the opportunity to have families, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status. Thirdly, while cloning may challenge traditional family values, it is important to recognize that families come in all shapes and sizes. Cloning can provide individuals with the opportunity to have children and families, which is a fundamental aspect of human life. It is important to regulate cloning technology to ensure that it is used for ethical purposes, but it is not inherently unethical. Do you have any further questions?",

        " Respected judges and fellow competitors,\n\nCloning ethically is not acceptable for these reasons. First, cloning damages human dignity by making a copy of an existing human. Every human life is unique and precious, cloning breaks that. Second, cloning conflicts with the principle of procreation within marriage through a loving relationship. Cloning bypasses natural human reproduction. Third, cloning threatens the family unit by potentially allowing same-sex couples and single parents to clone themselves. The traditional family structure benefits children the most. For these reasons, I argue cloning ethically is not acceptable.",
        " You raise some fair points. However, I still maintain that cloning goes against basic principles of human dignity and natural procreation. \n\nRegarding dignity, even if cloning helps some individuals have children, it still treats humans as mere \"products\" to be manufactured. The child's identity, though unique, is merely a copy  of an existing person which depersonalizes them.\n\nOn procreation, simply because cloning serves as an alternative to natural conception does not make it equivalent. Cloning bypasses the intimate loving act between parents that teaches a child the importance of relationships.\n\nAs for family, while we determine what constitutes a family, cloning challenges the fundamental idea that each family member is created through a loving, life-giving act between parents. You claim cloning can help all individuals have children, but lasting family values do not form through mere technical reproduction.\n\nWhile there may be benefits, cloning challenges core principles of human dignity, procreation and family that have underpinned civilizations for millennia. Though it requires nuanced regulation, I still argue cloning is ultimately unethical due to violating these fundamental principles. Do you have any follow-up questions?",
        "  You raise some fair points about cloning potentially helping infertile individuals have children and form families.  However, I still maintain that cloning is ultimately unethical.\n\nWhile cloned children may develop unique identities, they are still conceived through an industrial process rather than an organic loving act between parents. This objectifies human life and depersonalizes the child's origins.\n\nJust because cloning may allow infertile individuals to have children does not make it ethically equivalent to natural reproduction. Cloning bypasses the intimacy of human conception that teaches the inherent value of a child.   \n\nWhile families come in all forms, cloning challenges the very basis of what makes a family unit - that each member is created through the love and bond between parents. Cloning provides a technical means, not an ethical end.\n\nWhile regulation  could limit abuses, cloning still violates core principles of dignity, procreation and family. There are other ways to help infertile individuals form families that do not require compromising  these fundamental ethics. Responsible regulation would likely need to place tight limits on application of cloning.\n\nIn summary, while I understand cloning's potential benefits, I believe it violates fundamental understandings of human dignity and family that make cloning ultimately unethical. Do you have any additional questions?",
