        "As a senior debater, I strongly believe that parents should decide which career their children will pursue. Parents have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can guide their children towards a career that aligns with their interests, skills, and values. Moreover, parents have a vested interest in their children's success and well-being, and they are more likely to make decisions that will benefit their children in the long run. \n\nOn the other hand, children may not have a clear understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, or the job market and industry trends. They may also be influenced by peer pressure or societal expectations, which can lead them down a path that is not suited to their abilities or interests. Therefore, it is essential for parents to play an active role in their children's career development and help them make informed decisions that will set them up for success in the future.",
        "I appreciate the negative side's perspective, but I must respectfully disagree. While autonomy and self-determination are essential, parents have a responsibility to guide their children towards a career that aligns with their interests, skills, and values. Parents can provide valuable insights into the job market and industry trends, which can help their children make informed decisions about their future. \n\nMoreover, parents can help their children develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen career. They can provide financial support for education and training, offer mentorship and networking opportunities, and provide emotional support during the ups and downs of the job search process. \n\nI also disagree that parents may not have a comprehensive understanding of their children's interests and passions. Parents have a unique insight into their children's personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, which can help them identify potential career paths that their children may not have considered. \n\nFinally, while the job market is rapidly changing, having a clear career path can provide stability and direction in an uncertain world. By allowing parents to guide their children towards a career that aligns with their interests and skills, we can help them develop the adaptability and diverse skill sets needed to succeed in the long run.",
        "I appreciate the negative side's response, but I must respectfully disagree. While it is essential for children to develop decision-making skills and take responsibility for their choices, parents can still play a crucial role in guiding their children towards a career that aligns with their interests and skills. \n\nWhile parents' insights into job markets and industry trends may not always be up-to-date, they can still provide valuable guidance and support. Children can also conduct their research and consult various sources to make informed decisions, but parents can help them navigate the overwhelming amount of information available and provide a different perspective.\n\nMoreover, while allowing children to explore and choose their careers can foster personal growth and self-discovery, it can also lead to indecision and uncertainty. By providing guidance and support, parents can help their children make informed decisions and set them up for success in the long run.\n\nFinally, while a clear career path determined by parents may limit adaptability and diverse skill development, it is still possible to develop these skills through education, training, and on-the-job experience. By guiding their children towards a career that aligns with their interests and skills, parents can help them develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in the long run.",

        "As the negative side, I firmly believe that parents should not decide which career their children will pursue. The primary reason for this stance is that individuals have the right to autonomy and self-determination, which includes choosing their own career paths. Additionally, parents may not always have a comprehensive understanding of their children's interests, strengths, and passions, which are crucial factors in determining a fulfilling career. Furthermore, the rapidly changing job market requires adaptability and diverse skill sets, which can only be developed if individuals are allowed to explore and pursue careers that genuinely interest them. In conclusion, allowing children to choose their own careers fosters personal growth, satisfaction, and success in the long run.",
        "I understand the positive side's argument, but I maintain that parents should not decide their children's careers. While parents can provide guidance and support, the ultimate decision should rest with the individual. It is crucial for children to develop decision-making skills and take responsibility for their choices, which includes selecting their career paths.\n\nFurthermore, parents' insights into job markets and industry trends may be outdated or biased, leading to misguided advice. Children should be encouraged to conduct their research and consult various sources to make informed decisions.\n\nAdditionally, while parents may have some understanding of their children's interests and passions, they cannot fully comprehend their children's internal experiences. Allowing children to explore and choose their careers fosters personal growth and self-discovery.\n\nLastly, a clear career path determined by parents may limit adaptability and diverse skill development, hindering children's ability to navigate the ever-changing job market.",
        "I acknowledge the positive side's points, but I still assert that parents should not decide their children's careers. While parental guidance is valuable, it should not override the child's autonomy in making career choices.\n\nParents can provide support and advice, but the final decision should be made by the child, who will ultimately be responsible for their career and happiness. Overreliance on parental guidance may hinder the development of critical thinking and decision-making skills.\n\nAdditionally, indecision and uncertainty are natural parts of personal growth and self-discovery. By navigating these challenges, children develop resilience and adaptability, essential skills for long-term success.\n\nLastly, while it is possible to develop diverse skills through education and training, a career path determined by parents may not align with the child's true interests and passions. This misalignment can lead to dissatisfaction and decreased motivation, ultimately hindering the child's success in their chosen field.",
        "While I appreciate the positive side's emphasis on parental guidance, I maintain that parents should not decide their children's careers. Providing guidance and support is different from making decisions on their behalf. Encouraging children to explore various career options and offering advice is essential, but the final decision should be left to the child.\n\nIndecision and uncertainty, while challenging, are valuable learning experiences that contribute to personal growth. Overcoming these obstacles independently fosters resilience and adaptability, which are crucial for long-term success.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to differentiate between parental support and over-involvement. Over-involvement may hinder the child's ability to develop self-reliance and critical thinking skills, which are necessary for navigating the job market and industry trends.\n\nIn conclusion, while parents play a crucial role in providing support and guidance, they should not decide their children's careers. Respecting the child's autonomy and decision-making abilities is vital for their long-term success and happiness.",
        "In summary, the positive side argues that parents should play an active role in guiding their children's career choices, emphasizing the importance of parental guidance and support.
