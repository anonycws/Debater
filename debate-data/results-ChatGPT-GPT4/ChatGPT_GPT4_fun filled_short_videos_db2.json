        "I believe that the popularity of short videos is a manifestation of spiritual and cultural richness. Short videos have become a global phenomenon, and their popularity is a reflection of the changing times. Short videos are a form of entertainment that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their social status or education level. They provide a platform for people to express themselves creatively and share their experiences with others. Short videos also offer a glimpse into different cultures and lifestyles, promoting cultural exchange and understanding. The rise of short videos has also led to the emergence of new art forms and creative industries, contributing to the development of the cultural and creative economy. Therefore, I argue that the popularity of short videos is a positive sign of the richness of our spiritual and cultural lives.",
        "I respectfully disagree with the negative side's standpoint. While it is true that short videos may not always be profound or thought-provoking, they still have the potential to convey important messages and ideas. Short videos can be used to raise awareness about social issues, promote cultural diversity, and inspire creativity. Moreover, the popularity of short videos does not necessarily mean that people are no longer interested in more profound forms of art and culture. In fact, short videos can serve as a gateway to other forms of art and culture, encouraging people to explore and appreciate different art forms. As for the negative side's argument that short videos promote a culture of vanity and materialism, I believe that this is a sweeping generalization. While some short videos may focus on materialistic values, many others promote positive values such as kindness, empathy, and social responsibility. Overall, I believe that the popularity of short videos is a reflection of our society's evolving cultural and spiritual values, rather than a lack thereof.",
        "I appreciate the negative side's perspective, but I believe that their argument is based on a narrow view of short videos. While it is true that some short videos may focus on superficial content, this does not mean that all short videos lack depth or meaning. There are many short videos that convey important messages and ideas, such as those that promote social justice, environmental awareness, and mental health. Furthermore, the accessibility of short videos can actually increase people's interest in more profound art forms, as they may be inspired to explore related topics in greater depth.\n\nAs for the negative side's argument that short videos contribute to decreased attention spans and reduced critical thinking skills, I believe that this is a simplistic view of the issue. While it is true that some people may use short videos as a form of mindless entertainment, others may use them as a way to learn new skills or gain knowledge. Moreover, the rise of short videos has also led to the emergence of new art forms and creative industries, which can contribute to the development of the cultural and creative economy. Overall, I believe that the popularity of short videos is a reflection of our society's evolving cultural and spiritual values, rather than a lack thereof.",
        "I understand the negative side's concerns about the prevalence of superficial content in short videos. However, I believe that this is not a problem unique to short videos, but rather a broader issue in our society's media landscape. The negative side's argument that short videos discourage people from engaging with more complex cultural expressions is not supported by evidence. In fact, short videos can serve as a gateway to other forms of art and culture, inspiring people to explore related topics in greater depth.\n\nRegarding the quality and depth of information presented in short videos, I agree that there is a need for critical evaluation of the content. However, this is not a problem unique to short videos, as misinformation and oversimplification are prevalent in many forms of media. The positive side's argument that short videos can be used for learning new skills or gaining knowledge is supported by evidence, as many educational institutions and organizations use short videos as a tool for teaching and training.\n\nOverall, I believe that the popularity of short videos is a reflection of our society's evolving cultural and spiritual values, and that short videos have the potential to promote cultural exchange, creativity, and social awareness. While there are certainly challenges associated with the rise of short videos, I believe that these challenges can be addressed through critical evaluation and responsible consumption of media.",

        "The popularity of short videos is a manifestation of spiritual and cultural lack. While short videos can be entertaining and informative, their rise in popularity has led to a decline in the appreciation of more profound and thought-provoking forms of art and culture. The instant gratification provided by these videos has diminished our attention spans and our ability to engage in deep, meaningful conversations. Furthermore, the superficial nature of many short videos promotes a culture of vanity and materialism, rather than fostering intellectual growth and cultural enrichment. In conclusion, the widespread consumption of short videos reflects a lack of spiritual and cultural depth in our society.",
        "I understand the positive side's perspective on the potential benefits of short videos. However, I maintain that their popularity primarily reflects a cultural and spiritual lack. While short videos can indeed raise awareness about social issues and promote cultural diversity, the majority of popular short videos tend to focus on superficial content, such as pranks, challenges, and materialistic displays. This overshadows the more meaningful content and perpetuates a culture of instant gratification.\n\nMoreover, the accessibility of short videos may contribute to the decline in appreciation for more profound art forms, as people become accustomed to consuming content in bite-sized, easily digestible formats. The positive side's argument that short videos can serve as a gateway to other forms of art and culture is not supported by substantial evidence. In fact, the rise of short videos has been linked to decreased attention spans and reduced critical thinking skills, which may hinder the appreciation of more complex cultural expressions.",
        "While I acknowledge the positive side's argument that not all short videos lack depth or meaning, it is important to recognize that the majority of popular short videos do not promote intellectual growth or cultural enrichment.

The instant gratification provided by short videos may actually discourage people from engaging with more complex cultural expressions that require time and effort to appreciate.\n\nRegarding the argument that short videos can be used for learning new skills or gaining knowledge, it is crucial to consider the quality and depth of the information being presented. Short videos often oversimplify complex topics, leading to a superficial understanding of the subject matter. The emergence of new art forms and creative industries does not negate the overall negative impact of short videos on our society's spiritual and cultural values.",
