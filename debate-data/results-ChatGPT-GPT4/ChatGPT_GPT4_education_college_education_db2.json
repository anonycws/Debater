        "Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to argue that college education should not be compulsory. While higher education can undoubtedly provide valuable skills and knowledge, it is not the only path to success and personal fulfillment. Making college education compulsory would not only place an unnecessary burden on individuals who may not be suited for or interested in pursuing a college degree, but it would also strain our educational system and economy. Furthermore, it would devalue the importance of vocational training and alternative career paths that are essential to our society. Instead, we should focus on providing diverse educational opportunities and resources that cater to the unique needs and aspirations of each individual, allowing them to choose the path that best aligns with their goals and talents.",
        "Thank you for your perspective. While I acknowledge that a college degree can be beneficial in today's job market, making it compulsory would not necessarily reduce the income gap or promote social mobility. In fact, it could exacerbate the issue by creating an oversupply of college graduates, leading to increased competition for jobs and potentially driving down wages.\n\nMoreover, compulsory college education could result in a significant number of individuals pursuing degrees they are not passionate about or suited for, leading to disengagement and a waste of resources. Instead, we should focus on improving access to quality education and career guidance, allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their futures.\n\nRegarding vocational training, making college education compulsory could inadvertently devalue these paths by implying that a college degree is the only acceptable route to success. We must recognize and support the diverse talents and aspirations of individuals, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach.",
        "I appreciate your viewpoint, but I maintain that making college education compulsory is not the most effective way to ensure equal opportunities and promote social mobility. Instead, we should focus on improving access to quality education at all levels, including primary and secondary education, to create a strong foundation for future success.\n\nWhile it is true that some vocational careers require higher education, making college compulsory for all would not necessarily guarantee that individuals have the necessary skills and knowledge for these paths. Instead, we should invest in specialized vocational training programs that cater to the specific needs of these careers.\n\nFurthermore, compulsory college education could lead to a significant financial burden on both individuals and society, as the cost of higher education continues to rise. This could disproportionately affect lower-income families, further widening the income gap. By providing diverse educational opportunities and resources, we can empower individuals to choose the path that best aligns with their goals and financial capabilities.",
        "Thank you for your response. While I understand your argument, making college education compulsory may not be the most effective solution to ensure equal opportunities and promote social mobility. A more targeted approach, such as improving access to quality education and career guidance, would better address the root causes of inequality.\n\nRegarding vocational training, making college compulsory could still inadvertently devalue these paths by implying that a college degree is the only acceptable route to success. We must ensure that vocational training is recognized as a viable and valuable alternative to traditional college education.\n\nAs for the financial burden, while financial aid programs and scholarships exist, they may not be sufficient to cover the costs for all students, especially if college becomes compulsory. The long-term benefits of a college education may not outweigh the costs for everyone, particularly if they are not passionate about or suited for their chosen degree. Providing diverse educational opportunities remains crucial for individual and societal success.",
