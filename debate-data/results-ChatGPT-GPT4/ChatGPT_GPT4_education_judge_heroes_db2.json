        "I believe that it is advisable to judge heroes by their success or failure. Heroes are individuals who have achieved great things and have made significant contributions to society. Their success or failure is a reflection of their character, determination, and perseverance. By judging heroes based on their success or failure, we can learn from their experiences and use their stories as inspiration to achieve our own goals. Moreover, it is important to recognize that success and failure are not mutually exclusive. Heroes may experience setbacks and failures, but it is their ability to overcome these obstacles that make them truly admirable. Therefore, it is appropriate to judge heroes by their success or failure, as it allows us to appreciate their accomplishments and learn from their struggles.",
        "I respectfully disagree with the negative side's standpoint. While it is true that heroes should be recognized for their courage, selflessness, and dedication to their cause, their success or failure is an essential aspect of their story. Success and failure are not just about the outcome of their actions, but also about the journey they took to get there. By judging heroes based on their success or failure, we can learn from their experiences and use their stories as inspiration to achieve our own goals.\n\nFurthermore, judging heroes based on their success or failure does not necessarily disregard the complexities of their situations or the sacrifices they made. Instead, it allows us to appreciate the challenges they faced and the obstacles they overcame to achieve their goals. It is also important to note that success and failure are not mutually exclusive. Heroes may experience setbacks and failures, but it is their ability to overcome these obstacles that make them truly admirable.\n\nIn conclusion, judging heroes based on their success or failure is not a narrow-minded approach, but rather a way to appreciate their accomplishments and learn from their struggles.",

        "As the negative side, we firmly believe that it is not advisable to judge heroes by success or failure. Heroes should be recognized for their courage, selflessness, and dedication to their cause, rather than solely by the outcomes of their actions. Judging heroes based on success or failure is a narrow-minded approach that disregards the complexities of their situations and the sacrifices they made. It is essential to consider the intentions, moral values, and the impact of their actions on society, rather than merely focusing on the end result. By doing so, we can truly appreciate and honor the heroic qualities that inspire and motivate us to strive for a better world.",
        "While we understand the positive side's perspective on judging heroes by their success or failure, we maintain that this approach is limiting. Success and failure are often subjective and can be influenced by external factors beyond a hero's control. By focusing on these outcomes, we risk overlooking the true essence of heroism, which lies in their courage, selflessness, and dedication to their cause.\n\nMoreover, judging heroes based on success or failure may lead to an oversimplification of their stories, reducing their experiences to mere wins or losses. This approach fails to acknowledge the nuances of their journey and the lessons that can be learned from their struggles, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn addition, heroes often inspire others through their values and actions, not just their achievements. By emphasizing success or failure, we may inadvertently prioritize material accomplishments over the moral and ethical qualities that make heroes truly admirable.",
        "We acknowledge the positive side's argument, but we still contend that judging heroes solely on success or failure is limiting. While these outcomes can provide valuable lessons, they should not be the primary criteria for evaluating heroism. By focusing on success or failure, we risk perpetuating a results-oriented mindset that may discourage individuals from pursuing noble causes if the odds of success are low.\n\nAdditionally, the positive side's argument assumes that success and failure are clear-cut indicators of a hero's character, determination, and perseverance. However, these outcomes can be influenced by external factors, such as luck or circumstances, which may not accurately reflect a hero's true qualities.\n\nLastly, we reiterate that the essence of heroism lies in the values and actions of an individual, not just their achievements. By emphasizing success or failure, we may inadvertently prioritize material accomplishments over the moral and ethical qualities that make heroes truly admirable and inspiring.",
        "We appreciate the positive side's perspective, but we maintain that judging heroes primarily on success or failure is not the most comprehensive approach to evaluating heroism. While these outcomes can offer insights into a hero's character, determination, and perseverance, they should not overshadow the importance of their values, actions, and intentions.\n\nMoreover, we argue that emphasizing success or failure can indeed perpetuate a results-oriented mindset. By focusing on these outcomes, we may inadvertently send a message that only those who achieve tangible success are worthy of admiration, potentially discouraging individuals from pursuing noble causes with uncertain outcomes.\n\nLastly, we agree that success and failure can provide valuable lessons and inspiration. However, we emphasize that the essence of heroism lies in the values and actions of an individual, regardless of the outcome. By recognizing the importance of both material accomplishments and moral and ethical qualities, we can foster a more holistic understanding of heroism.",
        "In summary, while the positive side argues that success and failure are important aspects of evaluating heroism, we maintain that this approach is not comprehensive and can perpetuate a results-oriented mindset. We believe that the essence of heroism lies in the values, actions, and intentions of an individual, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe positive side's emphasis on success and failure may inadvertently prioritize material accomplishments over moral and ethical qualities, potentially discouraging individuals from pursuing noble causes with uncertain outcomes. We argue that by recognizing the importance of both material accomplishments and moral and ethical qualities, we can foster a more holistic understanding of heroism.\n\nIn conclusion, we advocate for a broader perspective on heroism that goes beyond success and failure, focusing on the values, actions, and intentions that truly define a hero and inspire others to strive for a better world."
