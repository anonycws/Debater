        "As a senior debater, I strongly believe that husband and wife should have privacy. Marriage is a sacred bond between two individuals, and it is essential to respect each other's privacy. Privacy is not only a fundamental human right, but it also helps to build trust and intimacy in a relationship. Without privacy, individuals may feel suffocated and may not be able to express themselves freely. Moreover, privacy allows individuals to maintain their individuality and independence, which is crucial for a healthy relationship. It is also important to note that privacy does not mean secrecy. It means having personal space and boundaries that should be respected by both partners. Therefore, I firmly support the idea that husband and wife should have privacy.",
