        "I believe that it is advisable to judge heroes by their success or failure. Heroes are individuals who have achieved great things and have made significant contributions to society. Their success or failure is a reflection of their character, determination, and perseverance. By judging heroes based on their success or failure, we can learn from their experiences and use their stories as inspiration to achieve our own goals. Moreover, it is important to recognize that success and failure are not mutually exclusive. Heroes may experience setbacks and failures, but it is their ability to overcome these obstacles that make them truly admirable. Therefore, it is appropriate to judge heroes by their success or failure, as it allows us to appreciate their accomplishments and learn from their struggles.",
        "Thank you for your statement. While I agree that success alone is not a reliable indicator of virtue and merit, I believe that it is still important to consider success and failure when judging heroes. Success and failure are not the only factors to consider, but they are important indicators of an individual's determination, perseverance, and ability to overcome obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, I disagree that failure does not diminish virtue. While it is true that many heroes who fought for just causes ultimately failed, it is important to recognize that failure can also be a result of poor decision-making or lack of effort. We should not reward failure for its own sake, but rather recognize the effort and intention behind the actions.\n\nFinally, I agree that the motivations behind an endeavor matter, but I believe that success and failure are still important indicators of an individual's character and determination. Someone who risks much to help others selflessly, with no promise of success, is certainly heroic, but their success or failure in achieving their goal is still an important factor to consider.\n\nIn summary, while success and failure are not the only factors to consider when judging heroes, they are important indicators of an individual's determination, perseverance, and ability to overcome obstacles.

        " Honorable judges and fellow debaters, \n\nI intend to establish that judging heroes by the yardstick of success or failure alone is inappropriate and fails to capture the full complexity of heroism. \n\nThere are three main reasons for my assertion. Firstly, success is often an unreliable indicator of virtue and merit. Many immoral individuals have succeeded through unethical means, while principled individuals may fail through no fault of their own. We must look beyond outcomes to examine intentions and actions.\n\nSecondly, failure does not necessarily diminish virtue. Many heroes who fought for just causes ultimately failed. Their attempts count for something, revealing moral character. We ought to reward integrity, even in failure.\n\nFinally, the motivations behind an endeavor matter more than its fruits. If someone risks much to help others selflessly, with no promise of success, their heroism lies not in achievement but in moral intent.\n\nIn summary, judging people purely by outcomes reduces heroism to a crude utilitarian calculus, neglecting virtues of integrity, sacrifice and moral motivation. I argue we must examine the complexity of human intention and character, beyond the one-dimensionality of success or failure.",
        "  Thank you for sharing your perspective. While success can indicate determination and perseverance, I would argue it remains an imperfect measure of heroism.\n \nYou question whether failure indicates lack of effort but many heroes strove tremendously yet ultimately failed - their efforts alone demonstrate virtue. Martin Luther King Jr's efforts, for example, though failed to fully realize racial justice during his life, reveal moral character.\n \nYou claim we should not \"reward failure for its own sake\" but heroes are not seeking  reward; they act out of conviction. What matters is not external outcome  but internal motivation.   \n\nYou suggest success indicates character but I would argue character is revealed through what one attempts and is willing to risk, not what one attains. The real test of character lies in facing failure with grace and resolve, continuing the struggle.  \n\nIn summary, while success can correlate with virtues, it remains an imperfect and reductive metric for true heroism, which resides in moral purpose and perseverance - revealed through what  one attempts and how one endures difficulty, not external outcomes alone. Heroes deserve recognition for effort and intention, regardless of success.",
        " You make a fair point that success reflects determination and ability to overcome obstacles. However, I argue this only imperfectly captures heroism.\n \nWhile failure can indicate lack of effort, it can equally result from circumstances beyond one's control. We must consider intention, not outcome alone. King fought hard and the faults lay not in him, but in systems of injustice and prejudice he sought to change.   \n\nYou suggest success reflects character but true character lies in one's aims and convictions, in what one is willing to risk and sacrifice. The fundamental test of character is moral purpose,revealed through intention and effort - not external validation of success.     \n   \nAt risk of repetition, I stress that what matters most is not achievement of goals, but the nobility of those goals and the moral struggle to achieve them, continued with integrity regardless of outcome. This reveals the essential character of a hero.  \n \nIn summary, while determination and ability to achieve goals do reflect virtue, they remain imperfect measures of true heroism, which resides fundamentally in moral purpose and sacrificial effort - revealed through what one attempts and struggles for, irrespective of outcomes. Heroes deserve recognition for effort and virtue of intention, beyond success or failure alone.",
        " You raise fair points about how success reflects determination and effort worthy of recognition. However, I argue intention matters more than outcomes when judging true heroism.\n  \nWhile rewarding failure alone is misguided, focusing solely on external results risks missing the moral struggle that reveals noble character - the struggle itself, irrespective of outcome, demonstrating virtue more than success.   \n\nYou claim success reflects determination but many heroic figures faced continual failure that did  not diminish their moral purpose or efforts. Their struggle itself, more than results, exemplifies virtues we should seek to emulate. \n \nIn summary, while determination and perseverance are admirable, they become truly heroic when directed toward a moral purpose - and that moral purpose and struggle, revealed through noble intention and sacrificial effort, matter more for judging true heroes, irrespective of outcomes. The ability to persist with integrity in a worthy cause, enduring difficulty, reveals character that success alone cannot give.\n\nWhat matters most for judging heroes, therefore, is not what they achieve but what they attempt and struggle for, unwilling to relinquish a just cause regardless of whether they prosper. Such steadfast moral motivation, revealed through noble intention and effort, constitutes the essence of heroism.",
        " In summary, my esteemed opponent claims that while intention and effort are important, success and failure still meaningfully indicate heroism by reflecting perseverance and ability to overcome obstacles.  \n\nWhile I concede that success demonstrates determination worthy of recognition, I argue intention matters more for true heroism. The moral purpose and struggle reveal character, independent of outcomes.\n  \nMy opponent suggests focusing on results does not neglect intention, but I argue external success alone falls short - it risks missing the noble struggle that comes from moral conviction, a struggle that constitutes heroism regardless of prospering.\n  \nMy opponent claims success is compatible with recognizing effort but many heroes faced continual failure yet exemplify virtue through moral aim and sacrifice, demonstrating character surpassing what mere success could provide.  \n\nIn conclusion, while determination merits honor, heroism resides fundamentally in moral purpose and sacrificial struggle - revealed through what one attempts and persists with, irrespective of outcome. The ability to continue righteous efforts with integrity, enduring difficulty, exemplifies character that success alone cannot provide and therefore matters more for judging true heroes."
