        " \n\nRespected judges and fellow debaters,\n\nI will argue that it is ethically permissible for parents to select the gender of their future children. While many concerns have been raised, at its core procreation involves parental choices about the creation of offspring. Gender selection, in reasonable limits, falls within ethical procreative freedom. \n\nFirst, parents have a moral right to make basic choices regarding their children's identities. Which language they speak, religion they follow and even names they go by shape who a child becomes. Gender is similarly a fundamental part of personhood that parents should be able to select within reason.\n\nSecond, gender selection can have benefits. It allows families to achieve balance, with children of each gender. It can assist couples coping with genetic disorders that only affect one sex. And it permits parents to satisfy a strong preference for a child of one gender. While gender itself is a social construct, the experience of living within a gender identity is real.\n\nIn summary, I argue gender selection should be an available option for parents, alongside other reproductive choices. But it must be carefully regulated to prevent abuse and ensure access is not restricted based on discriminatory biases. With ethical oversight and limits, selecting gender represents an extension of reasonable procreative liberty that most parents should have.\n\nI welcome the counterarguments from the opposing side, thank you.",
        " Here is my response in 150 words:\n\nWhile I understand your concern about reinforcing gender stereotypes, I believe parents should have the freedom to select the gender of their children within reasonable limits. Not all parents who undergo gender selection do so based on stereotyped preferences. Some simply wish to experience having a child of each gender. \n\nYou point to a potential slippery slope towards selecting other traits, but gender is a fundamentally different and more socially significant aspect of a person's identity compared to intelligence or appearance. Parents already shape many facets of a child's identity through their choices, and gender is one of the most basic.\n\nI would argue that the real source of discrimination is not the fact that parents can select gender, but the gender stereotypes and inequalities within society. Even without gender selection, stereotypes and discrimination will persist until we change hearts and minds. Banning gender selection risks needlessly infringing on  parental choices, while doing little to actually reduce gender biases.\n\nA better approach would be to regulate but not prohibit gender selection, while also working to combat systemic discrimination and promote gender equality in broader society. This would allow parents reasonable freedom of choice, while also challenging the stereotypes that underlie some of those choices.\n\nIn summary, while we should work to reduce gender biases, outright banning gender selection risks overcorrecting at the expense of parental autonomy. A more balanced approach that regulates but does not prohibit the practice may be more ethically justifiable.",
        " Here is my 149-word response:\n\nWhile you raise valid concerns, I believe you underestimate the reasonableness of most parents and the potential benefits of gender selection within proper safeguards:\n\nRegarding discrimination and inequality, I agree we must be vigilant against biases, but banning gender selection won't eliminate them on its own. Even without selection, gender stereotypes persist. Allowing it in moderation gives parents a reproductive choice while also forcing society to confront biases directly.  \n\nOn balancing family needs, simply adopting cannot replace the experience of parenting a biologically related child of each gender. For many parents, this balance relates to desire for variety of experience, not valuing one gender more highly. \n\nThe slippery slope concern is overstated. Gender is a fundamental aspect of identity in a way intelligence and appearance are not. Proper government oversight could allow gender selection while restricting other traits.\n\nIn summary, while regulation is needed, an outright ban infringes unjustifiably on reproductive freedom and family diversity. A moderate policy that allows gender selection with oversight balances parental choice and social risks more ethically. We should focus political will on eliminating biases, not restricting parental options.\n\nThe key is moderate policy that enables ethical reproductive choices within safeguards against abuse and discrimination. An extreme ban is unnecessary.",
        " While I appreciate your concern for gender equality, I think banning gender selection goes too far and would infringe on parental autonomy.   \n\nWhile gender selection may perpetuate some biases, banning it would be ineffective and heavy-handed. Parents will find ways around such bans, so a better approach is promoting gender equality through education and social change.      \n\nYou argue other ways exist to achieve family balance besides gender selection, but adoption and fostering are very different from having a biological child. Parents should be free to determine the size and gender makeup of their biological family, within moral limits.       \n\nYou raise a valid concern about a slippery slope, but gender is distinct enough from other traits that a ban on selecting gender need not lead to bans on selecting other traits. Regulation could consider gender a special case due to its social and biological importance.\n\nIn summary, while I agree we must be careful not to promote harmful biases, banning gender selection goes beyond what is necessary. A better approach is promoting gender equality through education, while respecting parents' autonomy to determine the gender of their biological children.",
        " Here is a 116 word summary of the statement questioning the opponent's view:\n\nWhile I respect the concern for promoting gender equality, I believe banning gender selection goes too far and risks infringing on parental autonomy.   \n\nThe argument that a ban would be an \"important step\" is speculative; there is no proof a ban would meaningfully reduce bias when many parents will find ways around it.  \n\nThe desire for biological children of each gender is a basic aspect of parental autonomy and family planning; combating stereotypes through education is a better approach than infringing on this.   \n\nWhile I agree we must be wary of a slippery slope, gender is distinct enough from other traits that regulation focusing specifically on gender need not lead to bans on selecting other traits.   \n\nIn summary, while striving for gender equality is important, banning gender selection is an ideological overreach that risks infringing on parents' freedoms without meaningfully reducing gender bias. A better approach is promoting gender equality through education."

        "My standpoint is that it is not ethically permissible for parents to pick the genders of their future children. The ability to choose the gender of a child is a relatively new technological advancement, and while it may seem like a harmless decision, it has significant ethical implications. By allowing parents to choose the gender of their child, we are perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes and reinforcing the idea that certain genders are more desirable than others. This can lead to a society where certain genders are valued more than others, leading to discrimination and inequality. Additionally, allowing parents to choose the gender of their child can lead to a slippery slope where parents may start to choose other genetic traits, such as intelligence or physical appearance, which could have even more severe ethical implications. Therefore, it is important to consider the ethical implications of allowing parents to choose the gender of their future children.",
        "Thank you for your response. While I understand your perspective, I still believe that allowing parents to select the gender of their future children is not ethically permissible. \n\nFirstly, while parents do have the right to make choices regarding their children's identities, this right is not absolute. We must consider the potential harm that could result from allowing parents to choose the gender of their child. For example, it could lead to a society where certain genders are valued more than others, leading to discrimination and inequality. \n\nSecondly, while gender selection may have some benefits, such as allowing families to achieve balance, these benefits do not outweigh the potential harm. Additionally, there are other ways to achieve balance in a family, such as adoption or fostering. \n\nFinally, while gender is a socially significant aspect of a person's identity, it is not the only aspect. Allowing parents to select the gender of their child reinforces the idea that certain traits are more desirable than others, which could lead to a slippery slope towards selecting other traits, such as intelligence or physical appearance. \n\nIn summary, while I understand the desire for parental autonomy, we must consider the potential harm that could result from allowing parents to select the gender of their future children. We should instead focus on promoting gender equality and combating gender stereotypes in broader society.",
